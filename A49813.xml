            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102409:3"/>as the Lord had ſaid, and a World of Wickedneſs, as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Current, ſtreamed in.</p>

               <p>After that, in every Age and Generation the Lord called true and faithful Witneſſes, and by the Influence and Virtue of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing qualified them, to bear teſtimony to his conſtant immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Loving-kindneſs, and againſt the Wickedneſs of the World, introduced by the Serpent, and to ſtir up men to look after, and wait for the Revelation and Manifeſtation of the bleſſed Seed, in whom the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed. <hi>Peter,</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Lamb, bare record, ſaying, <hi>Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21.

So that their Witneſs-bearing was an Effect of the Lords heavenly Appearance in them and among them; And who run without this, relying on their ſtock of Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences, they will be found falſe Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Without the concurrence of Spiritual Aid, ſaith <hi>Spark,</hi> the King's Chapline, the rareſt Orators are but as ſounding Braſs and tinkling Cimbals.</p>
               <p>Chriſt's Diſciples were unlearned men, but he gifted them, and made them learned in Spiritual Learning, before he ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, inſomuch that the Rulers, Elders, Scribes, High Prieſt, &amp;c. marvelled at the boldneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> perceiving that they were unlearned and ignorant men; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>As Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſaid of Councils, God is able, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Councils, but alſo againſt Councils, both to defend and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Kingdom, in <hi>Apol.</hi> So I ſay, Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day and forever, is able to qualifie and accompliſh, and doth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and accompliſh for the Miniſtry, ſuch as are his Miniſters, without ſending them to the bitter Waters of Heathen Wiſdom, Heathen Learning: 'Tis <hi>Heathen,</hi> not <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Education I ſpeak againſt.</p>
               <p>Further, the Apoſtles chuſing ſeven Deacons, we read not that they enquired for men profound in <hi>Heathen</hi> Arts and Sciences, but for men of Honeſt Report, full of the holy Ghoſt and Wiſdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. So that the holy Spirit only qualified for that Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was called of the Lord for the Goſpel Miniſtry: While un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched with the Finger of Heaven, his Recourſe was unto the High Prieſt, to receive Commiſſion from him; but after the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Touch, his Cry was, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9. While he had nothing but what he received at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> he ran a fierce Carreer, ſaith one, to the zenith of Perſecution; at length a heavenly <hi>Siſte gradum Saule,</hi> cauſed him to run Retrograde; and in his Apology before King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> he aſcribes his Call, not to <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6.

               <p>As for <hi>Biſhops;</hi> Goſpel-Biſhops, they are called of the Lord; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the holy Spirit hath made you Over-ſeers,</hi> that is, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.

               <p>Further, <hi>Paul</hi> called of the Lord, bare this Teſtimony, ſaying, <hi>How ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> Rom. 10.15. <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> ſaid on this place, This is ſpoken againſt them who go to the Miniſtry without a Call, who run, not being ſent; hereupon they do no good; what they do, 'tis for their Belleys ſake, not for the Glory of God. <hi>Poole</hi> on the ſame place, ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſaid, <hi>When he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up on High, he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto men; and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers; for the Perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry,</hi> Epheſ. 4. So that Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, Biſhops, Elders, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as truly ſuch, are qualified by the Gift of the Lord, not by Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts, Sciences, Endowments, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; though Tongues may be, and are uſeful in their place: <hi>Gave Gifts to men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; the <hi>Hebrew Pſalmiſt</hi> hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Thou received Gifts for men:</hi> Chriſt received them, that he might give them. <hi>Gave Gifts to men;</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> adds, <hi>Even to the Rebellious:</hi> The Rebellious have a Gift to lead them out of the ſtate of Rebellion, or to leave them inexcuſable, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> ſetting down the required Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Biſhops and Deacons, mentions no Mathematicks, Logicks, Spoiling Philoſophy, but <hi>Gravity, Blameleſneſs, Sobriety, Juſtice, Holineſs, Temperance, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.

               <p>Were ſuch men taken into holy Orders, ſaith the Author of the Book called, <hi>The Naked Truth,</hi> and conſtituted Paſtors, the Church of Chriſt would be better edified, though <hi>Plato, Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, Euclid, Scotus, Aquinas,</hi> were never known to them; the

                  <hi>holy Sciptures are able to make wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> If ſo, why are Heathen Philoſophers ſo much doted upon? <hi>And all Scripture is given by the Inſpiration of God; and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be Perfect, throughly furniſhed unto every good Work,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.

               <p>The Miniſterial Office may be better performed, ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, by Grave and Conſcientious men, though they never ſaw Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, nor know any Language, but their Mother-Tongue, than by any Ariſtoteliſt, Scotiſt, Aquinatiſt, with their knacks of Quiddities, Qualities, Syllogiſms, Enthimems, Diſtinctions &amp; Subſumptions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Were ſuch Grave and Conſcientious Perſons, ſaith this Author, admitted into the Miniſtry, as the Apoſtles ordained, ſuch Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet up as they practiſed, and all other decryed, then Thouſands in the Nations would preach the Goſpel for Conſcience ſake.</p>

               <p>The Call of God, ſaith <hi>Aug. Marlorat,</hi> on this place, makes a Lawful <hi>Office;</hi> this was common to <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> call'd them both.</p>

               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be blind, but was to have his Eye-ſight; implying, that Goſpel Miniſters, anointed with heavenly Eye-ſalve, are Quick-ſighted, not Blind, but Openers of Blind Eyes: 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Hagar, That God opened her Eyes, and ſhe ſaw a Well of Water,</hi> Gen. 21. So the Lord opens the Eyes of his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſee the Well of the Water of Life, and to feel its comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Virtue; ſo they cannot but invite others thereunto, and that Freely; and blind Watch-men are offended, ſuch as have no Call, but from Man, commended thereto through Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences: Theſe are Blind, not Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be Lame, Lameneſs was prohibited; Goſpel Miniſters are not Spiritually Lame, <hi>They run without Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, walk without Fainting;</hi> but Man made Miniſters are in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lameneſs, not knowing the uſe of that Foot that leads to Life; theſe halt in the Way: How can they ſay, as <hi>Paul,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Way-guide ſaid, <hi>Be ye Followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>And walk as you have us for an Example,</hi> Phil. 3.17.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to have a flat Noſe, ſuch as have their <hi>Olfactory Nerve,</hi> is often obſtructed, ſo that they are void of the ſenſe of Savour: Goſpel Miniſters, called of the Lord, they ſavour the things of the Lord, they ſavour the Sweetneſs of Chriſt's good Oyntment, and are refreſhed thereby; but Man made Miniſters, through a ſpiritual Obſtruction, they ſavour not the Things of God, but their Underſtandings are ſo darkned and depraved, as that <hi>they call Evil Good, and Good Evil; and put Darkneſs for Light, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102409:9"/>Light for Darkneſs; and put Bitter for Sweet, and Sweet for Bitter,</hi> Iſa. 5.20.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to have any thing Superfluous, Exceſs in Number, Quantity or Quality; implying, that ſuch as are truly called to the Evangelical Miniſtry, to the Goſpel Diſpenſation, what they are, they are in the Lord, New Creatures; Old Things are put off, all things are become New. <hi>James</hi> admoniſhed the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Tribes, <hi>To lay apart all Filthineſs, and Superfluity of Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and to receive with Meekneſs the Engrafted Word, which was able to ſave their Souls,</hi> James 1.21.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be broken Footed, nor broken Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What implies this? That ſuch as are truly called into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Miniſtry, they are Sound Footed and Handed; the Foot of their Mind keeps in <hi>Sions</hi> Way, it breaks not off from the Way of God, it keeps in the Path of Judgment; their Hands handle the Word of Life; but ſuch as have no Call, but of man, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters, broken off from the Path of Life.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be Crook-Backt: What implies this, but that Goſpel Miniſters, made ſo, contrary to the Will of Man, are not preſſed down with the weight and burden of worldly Cares? Now, what but the World, its Pleaſures, Profits, Lucre, Gain, Advantages and Preferments is in the Eye of Man made Miniſters?</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be a Dwarf, of ſmall Bodily ſtature; implying, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel, impowered from above, muſt not be ſtinted in ſpiritual Growth, not Novices of low ſtature in the ſaving Truth, but grow like the Palm Tree, Tall, Upright, always Green, Flouriſhing, Fruitful in ſpiritual Growth, always tending Heaven-ward, till they attain unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. But ſuch as are called by the will of Man, and ſtand therein, they are ſtrangers to the firſt Principle of pure Religion, not ſo far as the Novice, or young Schollar's ſtate; ſo no Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to have a Blemiſh in his Eye, whereby his ſight might be diminiſhed or depraved; implying, That the Evangelical Witneſſes, whoſe Eyes are anointed with ſpiritual Eye-ſalve, grow up in clearneſs of Underſtanding, for their comfortable walking with God, and for bringing of others into the Path of the Ranſomed; but Man made Miniſters may be exquiſite in Tongues,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102409:10"/>Arts, Hiſtories, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, Councils, Fathers, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet ſpiritually blind.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be Scorbutical nor Scabbed, wherein the Peccant humor of corrupt Blood ſo abounded, that it brake out and deformed the Fleſh; this rendred a man uncapable of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prieſts Office: What implies this, but that the Goſpel Miniſters ſhould through the Power, Virtue and Influence of the Croſs of Chriſt know the Fleſh Crucified, with the Affections and Luſts thereof, and lift up pure Hearts and clean Hands without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and doubting? but ſuch as have no Qualification, but from Man, from Natural Tongues, Arts, Sciences, Pagan Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, the Virtue of the Croſs not being known, Fleſh ruling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, manifeſts it ſelf without.</p>
               <p>The legal Prieſt was not to be <hi>Concuſſus teſticulo,</hi> that is, have his Stones broken; this Imperfection unqualified the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> diſ-inabled them from executing the Prieſts Office: This implies, that the Lord's Witneſſes under the Evangelical Diſpenſation, ſhould be enabled to beget others into the healing Power of the Living God. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. Phil. 10. Now Man made Miniſters beget others into dry, partched, ſandy Forms, without Power, and perſecute others for Non-Compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle gave a pregnant and lively Teſtimony for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Immediate Call, ſaying, <hi>As every man hath received the Gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. So Goſpel Miniſters miniſter out of the Treaſure of God's Gift; not from a ſtock acquired by Natural Languages, Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>Further, ſaith <hi>Peter, If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God: If any man miniſter, let him do it, as of the Ability which God giveth,</hi> verſ. 11. So that the true Miniſtry proceeds from the Spring of divine Ability; not from the muddy Lake of acquired Pagan Arts, Parts and Endowments.</p>
               <p>Nothing conduces more, ſaith <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> on this place, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Murmurings, then in conſidering that we miniſter not of our own, but what the Lord hath given us.</p>
               <p>Further, 'tis ſaid, <hi>I will give Power unto my two Witneſſes, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102409:10"/>they ſhall Propheſie a Thouſand Two Hundred and Threeſcore Dayes clothed in Sackcloth,</hi> Rev. 11.3. Goſpel Miniſters, ſaith <hi>Pareus</hi> on this place, who are the Lords Witneſſes, are impowered and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by the Lord, for the Performance and Diſcharge of their Work.</p>
               <p>After three dayes and a half, the Time of the Beaſts Reign, that aſcended out of the Bottomleſs Pit, and Locuſts coming out of the Smoke, Anti-chriſtian Teachers bred and qualified in the Smoke of humane Wiſdom, Spoiling Philoſophy, Unſavory School Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby Kindreds, Tongues and People are made Drunk. I ſay, after the Reign of the Beaſt, and of the Locuſts, Antichriſt and his Man made Miniſtry, <hi>John</hi> fore-tells the Reſtoration of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and of their Call to the Miniſtry; ſaying, <hi>The Spirit of Life from God entred into them,</hi> Rev. 11.11. So that the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of true Witneſſes of the true Miniſtry, after the Apoſtacy, ſhall be through the Operation of the Spirit; not through the Smoke of the Pit, Spoiling Philoſophy, School Divinity; and through the Operation of the Finger of the Antient of Dayes, <hi>The Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign forever and ever,</hi> Rev. 11.15.</p>
               <p>So that the Spirit of Life entring into men, after the Beaſt and his Locuſts, Anti-chriſt and his Miniſters have had their Day, is to be the only Qualifier for the Evangelical Diſpenſation. Moſt of the Miniſters among the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were Trades-men, as Merchants, Fiſher-men, Taylors, Shoe-makers, Husband-men; and theſe <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> antient <hi>Prateſtants,</hi> Witneſſes againſt the apoſtatiſed <hi>Roman</hi> Church, bare Teſtimony, That it were lawful for any to Preach, who were called of God: Though Strangers to Natural Tongues, Arts, Sciences, Philoſophy, ſuch the living God is raiſing up to ſtand on their Feet, and they muſt bear their Teſtimony in order to Seaſon, and rectifie the Nations; though by the Sons of Belial, under the Deluſion of Anti-chriſt, they be branded as Anti-magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical and Anti-miniſterial, and Perſecuted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> foreſaw a great Star fall from Heaven, to Earth, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Earth; an earthly Key was thruſt into the hand of his Mind, even the Key of the Bottomleſs Pit; out of the Pit aroſe a Smoke, darkning Sun and Air, Spoiling, Corrupting and Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Glory and Purity of the Primitive Church: What was this Smoke? Earthly Wiſdom guſhing as a heady Torrent into Church and School, Traditions, Errors, Lyes, ſtrange Doctrines, Superſtition, Idolatry, Lacivious Poems, Wanton Comedies, Vain Tragedies, Frivolous Fables, Spoiling Philoſophy, Heathen Logicks, Ethicks, Metaphyſicks: As this Smoke ſteamed into Church and School, the Pearl of heavenly Wiſdom, and the Pure, Divine, Immediate Call into the Miniſtry was loſt in the Smoke. Yea, and <hi>John</hi> foreſaw Locuſts come out of the Smoke: What's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102409:11"/>that?

               <p>The true Miniſtry was and is peculiar to the New man, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>John</hi> 20.21. But the heavenly Capacitating Ability, being loſt, through the Smoke of the Pit, a Qualification without was ſet up in the place of it, gained by Schools, Univerſities, Languages, Spoiling Philoſophy; ſo Preaching is made an Art of the old Man, by Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Let none apprehend that I deny Schools of Learning; for Schools teaching the knowledge of the Creation, and of uſeful and neceſſary Things, and Languages, uſeful in their place, I own; but 'tis the Lord of the Harveſt that muſt ſend forth Labourers into the Harveſt; Univerſities cannot do that.</p>
               <p>I might produce a Cloud of Witneſſes, ſhewing, that after the Beaſt was riſen out of the Sea, and Earth, Apoſtatiſed <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was become as Waters, Kindreds, Tongues, People and Nations profeſſing Chriſtianity, yet were made drunk with the Cup of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Spiritual Idolatry; no other Call into the Miniſtry was admitted, but what was gained at Schools and Univerſities, by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences; though in all or moſt of Ages, as by the <hi>Waldenſes, Albigenſes,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord had his Witneſſes, bearing Teſtimony to the Virtue and Power of a divine Call, and that without it, all Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences were inſignificant and inſufficient.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the thirteenth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 'twas Enacted, That none ſhould be made Miniſters, or admitted to preach, unleſs he were able to anſwer and render to the Ordinary an Account of his Faith in Latin, that is, he was to be a <hi>Linguiſt,</hi> a Schollar.

And muſt the Evangelical Diſpenſation, the Subſtance, the end of the Law, the end of the Prophets, the Glory of Diſpenſations, lean upon the bruiſed Reeds of a Humane Mediate Call, by Natural Tongues, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Arts and Sciences?

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This makes nothing for a Humane Mediate Call by the Will of man, but againſt it: The Apoſtles, after the Reſurrection and Aſcention of Chriſt, judged it expedient, that one ſhould be ordained a Witneſs with them of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Judas,</hi> who was gone to his place, they appointed two, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> men that had been converſant among them, had ſeen the glorious and wonderful Works of Chriſt, grew up in the Faith of the Goſpel with them; not trained up in Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences, Logicks, Spoiling Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Pagan Metaphyſicks, for that purpoſe; and the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Thou Lord, which knoweſt the Hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen,</hi> Acts 1.24 Mark this, Whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen.

From the dignity of the Calling, ſaith <hi>Aug.

There was a heavenly Gift in him, out of which, as a faithful Steward, he was to miniſter for the good of others. <hi>Timothy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aug.

And are any able to teach others, but who are taught of Chriſt? Who witneſs theſe things, in a great meaſure, they witneſs Fleſh Crucified: So who are able to teach others, or truly deſire to be ſerviceable to others, they are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually called thereto; Is it not ſaid, that <hi>It is God that worketh in man to will and to do of his own good pleaſure?</hi> This I ſay, that the Call of faithful men, of men able to teach others, is of God, and not of man. No Talent (ſaith <hi>Trap</hi> on this place) is given for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and proper uſe, but for the tranſmitting it to others, for their benefit and advantage.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>We learn Natural Tongues, Arts and Sciences, to enable us to underſtand Scriptures, and the Scripture and Spirit are inſeperable; ſo though we be ordained of men, yet we exclude not the Spirit, for the Spirit and Scripture are inſeparable.</hi>

               <p>Further, <hi>Simon</hi> had this acknowledgement, that the holy Spirit was the Power of God, and that mans having the Scripture without the Power ſignified little; but many teach and affirm now, that he that hath the Scripture, he hath the Spirit alſo, for they are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, and that the Scripture is the Power of God; herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of <hi>Simon.</hi>

               <p>Further, <hi>Simon</hi> bewitched the People: ſo man made Miniſters, who have nothing but from man, who keep people in their corrupt Interpretation of the Letter, out of that which gave out the Letter, the Spirit, and bring them not to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> to whom the true ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering is, ſuch are in ſpiritual Witchcraft, drawing People from the Life of Righteouſneſs, the Seed, in which the Families of the Earth are bleſſed, into the Dungeon of dead, dry, empty, ſapleſs Forms.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Simon</hi> gave out himſelf to be ſome great one; ſo man made Miniſters who know no Call but from man, be they Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, or Under-graduates, they are puft up with Heathen Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that knowledge puffs up, but Love Edifies: If the Lord of the Harveſt raiſe any to be his living Witneſſes, wanting Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences, ſuch are branded as Illiterate ignorant Mechanicks, and Perſecuted; as if the Goſpel Miniſtry were entailed upon Natural Languages, Heathen Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet the knowledge of Languages is uſeful in its place; but the Goſpel Miniſtry ſtands in that which was before Natural Languages.</p>
               <p>Though it be clear by Hiſtory, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> deſcended from <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond-woman, which thing they cannot deny, yet for Name and Kindreds ſake, they had rather be called <hi>Saracens,</hi> as if they deſcended from <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Free-woman, the Wife of <hi>Abraham.</hi> So man made Miniſters, though they plead againſt any Call but of man, and brand them as Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Enthuſiaſts, who plead for the Call of the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, or for ſeeing the Lord, or for the hearing of his Voice; yet theſe man made Miniſters would be called Miniſters of Chriſt, not of man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Natural Tongues, Arts and Sciences, are but ſuch qualifications as a Natural man may have, and the Natural man knows not the things of the Spirit of God, they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. So 'tis the Spirit, the heavenly Key; that opens Scriptures, not Natural Tongues, Arts and Sciences.

He told them not that they muſt have recourſe to Natural Tongues, Arts and Sciences, for to accompliſh them to underſtand Scriptures; No,

               <p>THe Apoſtles in the Power of the Lord laboured, and were livingly concerned to turn the <hi>Jew</hi> from <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> from <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> to Chriſt, in whom Oneneſs and the new Creature is witneſſed.</p>
               <p>After viſiting the Churches, before gathered, and in the Spirit of diſcerning, obſerving a Care begot in ſome particular Members, for the good, proſperity, growth, and decent order of their fellow Members; the overſight, care and charge of particular Aſſemblies
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102409:16"/>were commended to ſuch, and they were called Elders, becauſe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for the moſt part of the elder ſort of People, and the ſame were alſo called Biſhops, that is, Overſeers, or Superintendents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Office of overſeeing and taking care of the reſt.</p>
               <p>They were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> for that they were ſo in Age, (the Law having ſo provided, that no man ſhould be promoted to that Dignity, till he was thirty five Years old) or elſe becauſe they ought to be ſuch in Manners and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Carriage, ſaith Sr. <hi>Thomas Ridley</hi> in his view of the Civil and Eccleſlaſtical Law.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Firſt thought good, that not any under thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years of Age ſhould be ordained a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that is, an Elder: Afterward it was decreed by the Authority of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, that one might be made an Elder at twenty five Years old, <hi>Polydor. de Invent.</hi> lib. 4. But this limiting to a certain Year ſavours of the Will of Man, not of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis my Judgment, that the ſame Individuals, particular Perſons, that in the Purity of the Primitive Age, were ſometimes called <hi>Elders;</hi> they were alſo called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that is Overſeers, as the ſame Perſon may be ſometime called a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſometime a <hi>Teacher;</hi> this Doctrine in the Beauty of the Primitive Church, was not called <hi>Heretical,</hi> but <hi>tempora Mutantur,</hi> Times are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and in reference to the Identity, that is, oneneſs and ſameneſs of Elders and Biſhops in Primitive times, Scripture record is not altogether ſilent.</p>
               <p>Though in Scripture 'tis not <hi>in terminis,</hi> that is, expreſs words, that an Elder and a Biſhop were one and the ſame Order and Office, yet the circumſtantial Expreſſions are ſo ſtrong and pregnant, that they are Equivalent to a clear Expreſſion <hi>in terminis,</hi> that is, Expreſs Words, ſaith the Author of the Book, called, <hi>The naked Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Miletus,</hi> ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and called the Elders of the Church, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, that is, Biſhops,</hi> Acts 20.17, 28. <hi>Paul</hi> with the ſame Breath, as I may ſay, firſt calls them <hi>Elders,</hi> then <hi>Biſhops;</hi> this evidently proves them one, both in reſpect of <hi>Name,</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>Office,</hi> ſaith <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> ſaid, <hi>For this cauſe I left thee in</hi> Crete,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102409:17"/>
                  <hi>that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. Titus 1.5, 6, 7. So the very ſame that he calls Elders, he preſently calls Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, who am alſo an Elder, feed the Flock of God, taking the overſight thereof,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which may thus be rendred, <hi>Overſeeing the ſame as Biſhops,</hi> ſaith <hi>Darham,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.1, 2.</p>
               <p>So the very ſame Individuals, whom he firſt calls Elders, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently calls Biſhops, proving the Identity, Oneneſs, Sameneſs of Elders and Biſhops in the Primitive Church; theſe Titles were <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyma,</hi> Synonymous, both attributed to one and the ſelf-ſame Perſon: if they were not diſtinguiſhed then, who can juſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them ſince? The Jeſuit <hi>Lorinus,</hi> on this Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges this Identity; You ſee that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, taught of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, inſpired of God, were clear and pregnant for the confirmation of this Truth.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> as in other places, and upon other accounts, <hi>Theoderet, Occumenus, Clarius, Valla, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Bilſon,</hi> the Author of the Book, called, <hi>The naked Truth,</hi> men eminent in the Church ſince the Apoſtles dayes, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuch like, have born Teſtimony, that an <hi>Elder</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the Apoſtles Language were one and the ſame, and that they were Names indifferent, and uſed to the ſame Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michael de Medina,</hi> cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 15. <hi>de Clericis</hi> doth affirm, that not only <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Aerius,</hi> but alſo <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius, Auguſtinus, Sedulius, Primaſius, Chryſoſtomus, Theoderetus, Oecumenus</hi> and <hi>Theophilactus</hi> held out this Identity, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Wickliffians</hi> were of this Judgment: Hence it follows that there was no difference betwixt the Names and Offices of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes; the difference was not begun by any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Conſtitution, but upon Church-Cuſtom, Decrees of Councils, and ſuch other Grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe things we have ſpoken (ſaith <hi>Jerom</hi>) to ſhew that Elders and Biſhops were the ſame in the Primitive times, and that <hi>Biſhops</hi> may know that they are greater then <hi>Presbyters,</hi> (that is Elders) rather through Cuſtom, than by the Lords appointment.</q> This I own.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102409:17"/>
               <p>As the Smoke of the Pit aroſe, the Apoſtatical Leproſie over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpred, Diſcord and Contention aroſe about Religion; Men drew into Parties, one crying up this man, another that man; as in the Apoſtles dayes, one cryed he was for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollo,</hi> another for <hi>Cephas;</hi> and every one accounted thoſe his own, not Chriſt's, whom he Baptized. Then for the Eradicating the Seeds of Diviſions, and for the Reſtraining of Diſorderly Paſtors, it was decreed, <hi>That one ſhould be choſen out of the Presbyters, that is, Elders, and have Authority over them; and by way of Emineney be called Biſhop.</hi> Thus the Biſhop ſhoulder'd out the Elders, got Superiority over them, <hi>Polydor de Invent. rer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nations being converted, Biſhops increaſed, Differences aroſe: For the reſtraining or preventing of which, one was ſet over the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſo called Arch-Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Arch-Biſhops increaſing, to reſtrain or prevent Hereſies and Differences among them, one was ſet over them, called a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</p>
               <p>Patriarchs increaſing, to reſtrain or prevent Differences and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders among them; one was ſet up above them, called <hi>Catexochen;</hi> by way of Eminency, <hi>Papa,</hi> that is, Pope; though <hi>Papa,</hi> that is, Pope, before was a Name attributed to other Biſhops, <hi>Jerom</hi> on <hi>Titus, Naked Truth.</hi> Thus Elders and Biſhops, which were one Office in the pure Primitive Times, through the Ground of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, became divided: Thus Biſhop got Superiority over Elders, Arch-Biſhops over Biſhops, Patriarchs over Arch-Biſhops, Pope over the Patriarchs.</p>
               <p>For the maintaining of Uniformity in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> every Province was to be governed by one Prieſt, or more, who for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſake ſhould be called Biſhops: Then by permiſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, Kingdoms were divided into Dioceſſes, Dioceſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Shires or Counties, Shires into Pariſhes: It was decreed, <hi>That every Pariſh ſhould yield Obedience to their Pariſh Prieſt, the Pariſh Prieſt to the Dean, the Dean to the Biſhop, the Biſhop to the Arch-Biſhop, the Arch-Biſhop to the Primate or Patriarch, the Patriarch to the Legate, the Legate to the Pope, the Pope to General Councils, and General Councils only unto God,</hi> as they ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Title of Biſhop is of divine Inſtitution; the other of Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Primate, Patriarch, Metropolitan, Sub-Deacon, Arch-Deacon,

               <p>Theſe things being conſider'd, 'tis my Judgment, with the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and others that might be mentioned, that the ſame Individuals, who were in the Primitive Dayes, called Elders, they were alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Biſhops, that they were one and the ſame. <hi>Leigh</hi> alſo in his <hi>Critica Sacra</hi> ſaith the ſame, That the ſame Perſons, who were called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>CHriſt Jeſus, the Branch of Righteouſneſs, having called Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he influenced them with Salutiferous heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and armed them with heavenly Armour, that they might War under his Banner, againſt Abaddon, Apolyon, the old Serpent and his Kingdom, and be concerned as Inſtruments in the hand of she Lord, for the reſcuing of many out of his Captivity and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p>As the Diſciples, the Worthies and Warriers of the Lord, were called of Chriſt, ſo he appointed them their Work; they were to do his Work, grow up in like-mindedneſs with him, heavenly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: So he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Go therefore, and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. Teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Mat. 28. Conſider this, here was a divine Limit; they were to miniſter that, and nothing but that which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt, the Well-ſpring of Life and Living Mercies. Here the Smoke of the Bottomleſs Pit, Anti-chriſtians Doctrines, Error, Hereſie and Traditions are excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtin Marlorat</hi> ſaid on this place, <q>Chriſt ſent out his Apoſtles with this Exception, That they ſhould not preſs upon

               <p>Yea, and <hi>Poole</hi> our Country-man ſaith on this place, <q>Chriſt commands no other thing to be taught, than what he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; hereby excluding the Traditions and Inventions of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatiſed Men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Counſel of God,</hi> Acts 20.27. So Miniſters of Chriſt are to teach the Will and Counſel of God, not their own. But Man-made Miniſters are guilty in this caſe, who neither know the Call, nor do the Work, nor are content with the Wage of Goſpel Miniſters, though for Lueres ſake they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Saints at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> mentions the Work and End of the true Miniſtry; ſaying, <hi>When Chriſt aſcended, he gave Gifts unto men, to Apoſtles, to Prophets, to Evangeliſts, to Paſtors, to Teachers.</hi> To what end were theſe Gifts given? <hi>For the Perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, &amp;c. unto a Perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. Yea, and the Apoſtle writing unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their precious Growth, and high Attainment in the Life of Righteouſneſs, ſaying, <hi>Ye are come unto Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the City of the Living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Company of Angels; to the general Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt Born, which are written in Heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men made Perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.</p>
               <p>Now Man made Miniſters deny Perfection in this Life; ſo deny the end of the Miniſtry, of the truly Gifted Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers: Yea, and they exclude themſelves from the precious Attainments of the believing <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Yea, and they deny the Subſtance of the <hi>Aaronical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummius.</hi> What is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> was to have a Breaſt-plate of Judgment, in which was put the <hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102409:19"/>Diſpenſation, the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, with Urim and Thummim, Light and Perfection ſhould be received. Chriſt, the Breaſt-plate of Judgment and Righteouſneſs, the Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, Light and Perfection, ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Be ye Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. Yea, and the Apoſtles having received the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the Urim and Thummim Spiritually, Light and Perfection, they preached Perfection, as before is touched.

               <p>
                  <hi>Nehemiah</hi> foretold the Reſtoration of the <hi>Aaronical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Nehem.</hi> 7. So Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of Righteouſneſs, the heavenly <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> by interpretation, <hi>The Conſolation of the Lord,</hi> by the Breath of his Mouth, and by the Brightneſs of his Coming is chaſing away Smoke out of a Remnant, the Carnal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of <hi>Myſtery Babylon;</hi> and the Spirit of Life from God is entring into Witneſſes, and the true Breaſt-plate of Judgment, with Urim and Thummim, Light and Perfection, is reſtored and reſtoring.</p>
               <p>Now the Locuſts, Man-made Miniſters, which come out of the Smoke, are bred and formed in the Smoke of Earthly Wiſdom, they cannot endure to hear of the finding of them; plainly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they want the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs; for where it is, Urim and Thummim, Light and Perfection is witneſſed and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>

But Man-made Miniſters ſay, The Scripture is the Light: Such walk in the Region of the Shadow of Death; the Scripture was given out by the Eternal Light; a Declaration of it, of God, whence it came.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Apoſtles preached up the Baptiſm by one Spirit into one Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. as the permanent Baptiſm, of the Evangelical Diſpenſation, the Heart-cleanſing and Soul-ſaving Baptiſm, the Subſtance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Man-made Miniſters Sprinkle Infants, ſaying, thereby they are made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, Inheriters of the Kingdom of Heaven: Thus the Viſible is inthroned, and the Inviſible is diſ-throned, which truly makes Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt: <hi>Paedorantiſm,</hi> that is, Sprinkling of Infants came not in till Hundreds of Years after the Apoſtles dayes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Apoſtles knew Chriſt to be the Bread of Life, the Soul's Food, heavenly Manna; here they fed at the Table of the Lord, had fellowſhip one with another, were written in one anothers Hearts, theſe knew the Table and Supper of the Lord. Man-made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters tell of a Sacrament, for which there is no Scripture; 'twas the old <hi>Heathen Roman</hi> Military Oath; their Communion is in viſibles, Meat that periſhes; <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> Profeſſing this Communion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a Place of Skulls; as <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of Blood.</p>
               <p n="8">8. True Minſters knew the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſins
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102409:20"/>of the World, to be the Everlaſting Covenant, Glad Tidings to Captive Souls, to Priſoners of Hope; this Goſpel was preached to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.15.10 <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.8. Man-made Miniſters ſay, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is the Goſpel: Their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are a Declaration of the Everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Apoſtles preached Chriſt the Fountain of Life, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of Wiſdom and Knowledge, in whom the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells Bodily. Man-made Miniſters ſay, That <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> are the Fountain, Well-ſpring or Well-head of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the two Eyes of the Nation; Though founded in Popiſh Times for the Propagation of their Doctrine and Religion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Apoſtles preached the Word, which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be the Original, which was before <hi>Babel,</hi> many Languages, by which the Prophets and Apoſtles were called, and drew others into the one pure Language, to know the Virtue of the Everlaſting Goſpel. Man-made Miniſters ſay, that <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> is the Original: The <hi>Hebrews</hi> perſecuted Chriſt, the <hi>Greeks</hi> accounted the Croſs of Chriſt Fooliſhneſs: <hi>Pilate,</hi> who had <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the World's Original, he crucified Chriſt, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and Ending, the Firſt and Laſt, the Original, the Author of the pure heavenly Language.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Apoſtles preached the Saints to be the Temple of the Living God, Chriſt the Anti-type reigning in their mortal Bodies. Man-made Miniſters ſay, That a Houſe of Lime and Stone is the Temple: An Imitation of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, a Type, fulfilled and ended in Chriſt the Subſtance. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to Death for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing againſt the Temple, the Figure, when Chriſt the Subſtance was manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Apoſtles preached Chriſt, the one Offering, perfecting forever them that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. They preached Chriſt the end of that Prieſthood that took Tythe, the end of the Law that gave Tythe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. Man-made Miniſters preach up Tythe, the Heave-offering, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. the Shadow; ſo deny Chriſt, the One Offering: And by the ſame Rule they may introduce and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the other Offerings of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſthood.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Apoſtles, as Freely they received, ſo they Freely gave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Buy the Truth, but ſell it not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 23. The Wine and Milk of the Kingdom is to be bought;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102409:21"/>but how? <hi>Without Money and Price, Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Man-made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſay, They are gifted men; but will not part with their Gift, but for a certain yearly Sum: Wiſdom, the Gift of God is Free, and cannot be bought and ſold for Money. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>cannot be 'gotten for Gold, nor Silver, nor for Coral, Pearls, nor Rubies,</hi> cap. 28. Who think to purchaſe it, they are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, in the Bond of Iniquity, as <hi>Simon</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Such as Chriſt ſent, they preached, <hi>That every one had a meaſure of Light in him, leading to Life ſuch as received it, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſuch as received it not,</hi> Joh. 1.5.9. Joh. 3.19. Rom. 1.19. Luke 17.21. Man-made Miniſters deny this Doctrine, ſaying, 'Tis a <hi>Natural Light,</hi> and belch out Approbious Language againſt it; and that the Improvement of it advantages nothing: And all this to keep People in a Reliance and Dependance upon them; never to witneſs the new Covenant, the Law written in the Heart, the Spirit put in the Inward Parts.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians, That they might all Propheſie, that all might learn and be comforted; and if any thing was revealed to him that ſate by, the firſt was to hold his Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. This was Order in the true Church. Man-made Miniſters accounts this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Diſorder; for if any ſhould come in, and ſpeak while the publick Miniſter is ſpeaking, or when he hath done, how cruelly ſuch have been uſed, I need not mention, ſhewing that their Church-members are Branches of that old putred ſtock, that they were of, who ſtoned <hi>Stephen</hi> to Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Apoſtles preached Freedom from Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 7, 18. <hi>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>A Sanctified State,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>A Cleanſing from all Sin by the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 1 John 1.7. Man-made Miniſters teach another Doctrine, That there is no Freedom from Sin in this Life; and that a man muſt carry a Body of Sin and Death about with him, while upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> owned Chriſt's Doctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all, Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>James</hi> 5. But Man-made Miniſters plead for Swearing, ſaying, The Denyal thereof is an old Hereſie; yea, and many eminent in the Church ſince the Apoſtles dayes have born faithful Teſtimonies againſt Swearing, as Chriſt did, who ſpake with Authority.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102409:21"/>
               <p n="18">18. The Apoſtles owned Revelation; without it God is not known, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. Till this was witneſſed, <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Saul,</hi> a grand Perſecutor, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. Who are of God now, they bear witneſs to this. But Man-made Miniſters ſay, Revelation is ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So conclude all to be excluded from the Knowledge of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: 'Tis true, who are in the Will of Man, Night and Darkneſs is upon them, the Sun is ſet; Viſion and Revelation ſuch know not.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The true Miniſters of Chriſt preached Preſent Salvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace they were ſaved,</hi> Tit. 3.5. 1 Pet. 3.21. Man-made Miniſters preach Chriſt and Salvation at a Diſtance, telling what Glorious things Chriſt will do, and what Glorious things he hath done; but to know his Energy, inward effectual Operation at preſent, a preſent coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this is not preached up; In a word, they are ſuch Trumpeters, give ſuch an uncertain Sound, as that their Hearers are not at all Alarum'd, not all Arm'd, not at all Arm'd againſt <hi>Abaddon, Apolyon,</hi> the old Deſtroyer, but the ſtrong man Arm'd keeps the Houſe, hath rule in the Heart; in this ſtate man makes a ſhew of Religion and Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Thus Man-made Miniſters are ſtained with the Defilements of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Errors; and as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever Tranſgreſſeth, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath not God,</hi> 2 John 1.9. So conſequently hath nothing, <hi>Habet omnia, qui habit habentem omnia;</hi> that is, He hath all, that hath the Haver of all; ſo ſuch as are out of Chriſt's Doctrine, they are Heterodox, Heretical; yea, and according to <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine, Atheiſtical.</p>
               <p n="20">20. True Miniſters were and are Inſtruments in the hand of the Lord, to bring men to Righteouſneſs, and Eternal Life, out of the Dungeon of Death, Darkneſs and Unbelief, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. <hi>If they had ſtood in my Counſel,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and had cauſed my People to hear my Words, then they ſhould have turned them from their Evil Way, and from the Evil of their Doings, Jer.</hi> 23. But Man-made Miniſters, who creep into the Miniſtry without a divine Call, for earthly Ends, through the ſtrength of natural Abilities, they are like the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> without Dew and Rain; ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and unfruitful, and cannot enrich others, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21. Yea, they are like the Cramp-fiſh, whoſe ſtupifying and benumming
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102409:22"/>Quality, ſay Naturaliſts, iſſues from the Fiſh, to the Hook, then to the Line, then to the Angling-Rod, then to the Hand, then to the Body of the Fiſher, and ſo benums him, and takes away all uſe and feeling of his Limbs; ſuch like is the benumming, deadning and ſtupifying Quality of Man-made Miniſters; but ſuch as come in the living virtue of Truth, they make alive unto God, ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Teſtimony, and bring them to have all their Sences exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, to the diſcerning of Good and Evil.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Such as are called of the Lord, in the influence of his Power, they are carried on in the Performance of their Teſtimonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Stream and Current of mens Wills; the Lord opens their Mouthes, and Man cannot ſhut them; they are not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Men-pleaſers; God rather than men, is to be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto and obeyed: But Man-made Miniſters, who intrude into that Work, as a Trade, to get a Living by, eyeing the Fleece more than the Flock, theſe have been and are like dead Fiſh, driven on by the Stream and Current of humane Commands and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as their Mouthes are opened by man, ſo by the Injunctions of Man, they are ſhut: Such as have been called of man, have done the Work of man, hoiſting up their Sails to every Wind, complying with every Power that came up, bending unto the Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by them appointed, as Records fully teſtifie.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th denying the Popes Supremacy, brought the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> into a Praemunire, for their compliance with the <hi>Paepal</hi> Power; the Clergy in a Convocation reſolved upon a Humble Sumbmiſſion in writing, and gave the King one Hundred Thouſand Pound for a Pardon, in which Submiſſion they ſtiled the King, <hi>Supream Head of the Church:</hi> Thus the Clergy being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, got a new Head, denying the Pope, acknowledged the King to be their Head, <hi>Bakers Chron.</hi> Not long after the Clergy took an Oath, <hi>To Renounce the Pope and his Authority, and to be true and loyal to the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors; So God me help, and all Saints,</hi> ſaid they.</p>
               <p>After him ſucceeded King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, in whoſe Reign the Book of Common-Prayer was commended to the Nation, and eſtabliſhed, and received by the Clergy inſtead of the <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs: Now upon the Tranſlating of the <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs-Book into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (in this <hi>Edwara's</hi> days) there was a Riſing in <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> the King
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102409:22"/>wrote in this manner, to quiet them; <hi>As for the Service in the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue; perhaps it ſeems to you a new Service, when indeed it is no other but the old, the ſelf-ſame Words in</hi> Engliſh <hi>which were in</hi> Latin, <hi>ſaving a few things taken out ſo fond, that it had been a ſhame to have heard them in Engliſh.</hi> Thus the Common-Prayer came to be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Hiſtor. Magdiburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After him ſucceeded Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Maſs to be ſung again in <hi>Latin,</hi> and to be uſed in all Churches, ſo called; The Kingdom was abſolved, and reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Pool;</hi> Monaſteries were re-edified, firſt Fruits and Tenths were reſtored; to theſe things Prieſts and People generally complied: they took an Oath, to be true to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Pope their Holy Father, and to Perſecute to their power all Oppoſers; ſaying, <hi>So help me God, and the holy Evangeliſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Oathes and Reſolutions, in the Year 1559. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> coming to the Crown, ſhe with her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made an Act for Uniformity of Prayer, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments; the Title of <hi>Supream Head of the Church,</hi> was confirmed to her, the Popes Supremacy denyed; and of the Number of above nine Thouſand Prieſts, Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Colledges, Arch-Deacons, Abbots, formerly ſworn to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> not above one Hundred and twenty refuſed to take an Oath againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> ſo turned from their Religion to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Religion, becauſe the Queen ſet it up: notwithſtanding in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> dayes, they had burned ſome Hundreds for reſuſing to bow to <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After her King <hi>James</hi> confirmed the Common-Prayer-Book, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Canons and Conſtitutions, for Fonts, Tables, Carpets of Silk, Pulpits, Copes, Surplices, Hoods, Gowns with ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Collars, ſtrait Sleeves, wide Sleeves, Tippets, ſquare Caps, that People might know ſuch and ſuch, and Honour them.</p>
               <p>The long Parliament denyed the Common-Prayer, and by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of Prieſts, ſet out a Directory for publick Worſhip, in the Year 1644. the generallity of Miniſters conformed, and inveighed againſt the Common-Prayer-Book as <hi>Popiſh,</hi> calling it, <hi>Rags of</hi> Rome, <hi>dregs of the Whores Cup, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Maſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1653. <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> being made Protector, he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102409:23"/>made Proviſion for the Clergy, for their recovering of Tythe and other Dues, as they pretend, upon which they called him, <hi>A good Nurſing Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1658. <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> was made Protecter; the Clergy in a Petition called him their <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Petitioning him to lead them into the Promiſes Land; and what was that, but into rich Benefits and Augmentations?</p>
               <p>The King being reſtored, the Directory caſt out, as indirect, and the Common-Prayer enjoyned; how generally entertained by the Clergy, notwithſtanding the grievous Reflections of many of them againſt it, I need not mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aencas Sylvius,</hi> a private Man, wrote many things againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> after being made Pope, and called <hi>Pius,</hi> he undid what he had done, and wrote in the defence of <hi>Popery;</hi> whereupon one taunted him with theſe Words, <hi>Quod</hi> Aeneas <hi>damnavit,</hi> Pius <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavit;</hi> that is, What <hi>Aencas</hi> diſallowed of, <hi>Pius</hi> allowed of: So what Man-made Miniſters rejected as Heterodox, is at the pleaſure and command of Authority owned as Orthodox; but Truth, and the out-goings thereof are to be embraced becauſe of themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men fawn or frown.</p>
               <p>Thus who are in their own Wills, out of the pure Worſhip of God, which is in Spirit and in Truth, where true ſence is and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Divine Requirings, ſuch for Self-ends and Corporal eaſe, are carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, at the Commands and Injunctions of men; againſt the unconſtancy of theſe, in ſuch a weighty concern, dropped out this following Reflection:

               <p>Now man-made Miniſters, who run, uncalled of the Lord, for Tythe, filthy Lucre, Earthly ends, Advantages and Preferments, they are in a Spiritual Leproſie; and being ſtrangers to receiving freely, and giving freely, they make a diſtinction of Gifts: <hi>There are,</hi> ſay they,</p>

                  <item>2. Dona acquiſita, <hi>acquired Gifts, as the knowledge of Preaching, not now had without great Study, Labour and Coſt; as this is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten freely, ſo neither is it to be uſed without Recompence.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Who are of this mind, they exclude themſelves from the true Miniſtry, which acquired parts cannot bring unto; the Natural man, notwithſtanding his Accompliſhments, Natural Tongues, Heathen Arts and Sciences, is a ſtranger to the true Miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gift of God, and peculiar to the New man, Wiſdom, Knowledge, Faith, Healing, Miracles, Prophecy, diſcerning of Spirits, &amp;c. all came from one and the ſame Spirit, as the true ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bare Teſtimony, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And this Diſtinction hath not his allowance.</p>
               <p>Further, as Chriſt called Diſciples, and appointed them their Work, ſo he appointed them their Wage alſo; he inſtructed them how to carry themſelves both to them that received them, and to them that received them not: <hi>Into whatſoever Houſe ye enter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and they receive you, eat and drink ſuch things as they ſet before you, as they give you; for the Work-man is worthy of his Meat, the Labourer is worthy of his Hire,</hi> Mat. 10. Luke 10. Here a Wage, a Hire, a Maintenance was allowed to them; they had Chriſt's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for it: Wherein two things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That their Maintenance was Free and Voluntary.</item>
                  <item>2. That their Maintenance aroſe from ſuch as received them and their Doctrine: For the Diſciples were firſt to be received, before
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102409:24"/>they received any thing; as undeniably ariſes from the Words, <hi>Who ſo receive you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>eat and drink with ſuch.</hi> Now by the phraſe of Eating and Drinking, the neceſſary Conveninencies of Life are implied; as alſo by the phraſe of Food and Rayment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. It cannot reaſonably be thought, that Chriſt intended thereby to tye up his Miniſters to Meat and Drink only; but under that phraſe the neceſſary Conveniencies of Life are intimated.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Diſciples, the Apoſtles of the Lamb, had his Ordinance for their Maintenance, and of whom to receive it, and as they were taught <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to divide the Word aright: ſo they were taught <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to Foot it aright; as to Teach Well, ſo to Live Well: and how exactly they were obſervant of Chriſt's Ordinance, for their Maintenance, may hereafter further appear.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples were ſent out as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves, without Money or Braſs in their Purſes; upon their return, Chriſt asked them, ſaying, <hi>Lacked ye any thing?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>No:</hi> Going in his heavenly Power and Virtue, their Miniſtry was ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, prevalent and influential, as to open the Hearts of People, to miniſter to their Neceſſities in the Work of the Goſpel; ſo he who ſent them, maintained them in touching, influencing, and opening Hearts to miniſter to their Neceſſities, according to Chriſt's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon that account, provided they ſought no ſet annual Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, Salaries, Augmentations: They deſiſted not from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the want of a ſettled Maintenance, as Man-made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do, who when their Maintenance ceaſes, deſiſt their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fulfilling the old Proverb, <hi>No Penny, no Pater-noſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as Chriſt inſtructed his Diſciples how to carry and demean themſelves to them that received them, ſo he informed them how to carry and demean themſelves to them that received them not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your Words, when ye depart thence, ſhake off the Duſt of your Feet for a Teſtimony againſt them,</hi> Matth. 10. Mark 6. Luke 9. This was all the Extremity they were to uſe: he told them not they ſhould apply themſelves to Magiſtrates, and force People to maintain them, whether they received them or no; this is the Beaſts Doctrine, and his unclean Flogs; The Apoſtles duly and faithfully obſerved this Ordinance of Duſt-ſhaking, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.51.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102409:25"/>
               <p>Now you <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> of what denomination ſoever, who make Conſcience of Non-compliance with the National publick Miniſters, &amp; of not miniſtring Carnal things unto them; it ſeems you are ſuch as receive them not; Do they obſerve Chriſt's Ordinance? Do they content themſelves with ſhaking the Duſt off their Feet againſt you? My thinks I hear a general Anſwer in the Negative, <hi>No, No, they Sue us in Courts of Judicature, at Courts, Aſſizes; they Impriſon us; they recover Treble damages of us, for very Trifles and inconſiderable things, as Smoke-Pennys, Mortuaries, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Reckonings, Midſummer-Dues, Popiſh Inventions; they make Havock and Spoil of our Goods.</hi> In thus doing, they trangreſs Chriſt's Ordinance of Duſt-ſhaking, which the Apoſtles were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of, who uſed no Weapon but what was Spiritual, no Sword but that of the Spirit. Rev. 11.5. <hi>If any man hurt my Witneſſes, Fire proceeds out of their Mouth, and devoureth their Enemies.</hi> The Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, is the Weapon of the Lords Witneſſes, Goſpel-Miniſters: but the Beaſt that aſcends out of the bottomleſs Pit, ſhall make War againſt the Witneſſes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and Kill them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Now notwithſtanding the ſpecious pretences of men, as of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Ordinances, Reformation, Antiquity; yet if Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Duſt-ſhaking againſt ſuch as receive them not, be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but a Co-ercive Power uſed, Tythe, and other Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance forced, a procedure in Perſecution, Impriſonments, Spoiling of Goods, of ſuch as for Conſcience-ſake cannot receive them; they that act theſe things, are out of Chriſt's Doctrine, darkned by the Smoke of that Pit, which the Beaſt aſcended from, taking part with him, and not with the Lamb: So that Man-made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtand for another Call, Work, Wage and Weapons, than Goſpel Miniſters contend for.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Intention, which is, to ſhew, That the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Miniſters of Chriſt in the primitive Times, was free and voluntary, and that from ſuch as received them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> bare record unto the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted no mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparel; yea, you know that theſe hands have miniſtered unto my Neceſſities, and to them that were with me, Acts</hi> 20.33, 34. Whence we gather (ſaith <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> on this place) that no man is a true Miniſter of the Word, but he is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102409:25"/>alſo a Deſpiſer of Money. <hi>Abraham</hi> of old ſhewed a noble Mind, in taking nothing of the Spoil got from his Enemies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. But ſaith <hi>Poole, Paul</hi> ſhewed a far Nobler Mind, whenas he refuſed to take Neceſſaries for his weighty and Salutiferous Labour, relieving his Neceſſities with his own hands.</p>
               <p>In the ackowledgment of Chriſts Doctrine to his Diſciples, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Have we not Power to eat and to drink?</hi> Yes, <hi>Paul</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt, the Power of God, whoſe Ordinance to his Diſciples was, <hi>To eat and to drink ſuch things as were ſet before them, by them that received them:</hi> He had power to eat, drink and receive Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who received him and his Meſſage; though he wrote not for ſuch and ſuch ends, judging it his reward to make the Goſpel without Charge, that he might not abuſe his Power in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. This makes nothing for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Miniſters to force a Maintenance from ſuch as receive them not.</p>
               <p>Man-made Miniſters purſuing Tythes, and other Antichriſtian Wages, as the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt good, thunder out the words of <hi>Paul: Who goeth a Warfare at any time at his own Charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This contraries not Chriſt's Ordinance; but herein the Apoſtle ſhews by three Arguments, That Goſpel Miniſters may with a good Conſcience receive Neceſſaries from ſuch as receive them and their Doctrine. <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> tell me this; At whoſe Charge ought the Souldier to go, but at his, for whoſe Defence and Security he fights? The Apoſtles of the Lamb were Warriors, harneſſed out of the Lord's Armory, fighting under the Banner of Chriſt, the Captain of their Salvation; in whoſe hands they were Inſtruments to conquer many, to reſcue them from the Power of Satan, to reduce them into the Obedience of the Son of God, that they might be eternally Happy: Thus Warring for the good, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and defence of them, according to Chriſt's Ordinance, they might reap neceſſaries from them. You that are made Miniſters by the Will of man, this is no ground for forcing Tythe, and other Dues, as you call them, from ſuch as receive you not; you war not for ſuch, but againſt them, rendring them as Hereticks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting and impriſoning them, ſtirring up Magiſtrates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102409:26"/>them: Let ſuch as own you for their Warriors maintain you.</p>
               <p>He that plants a Vineyard may eat of the Fruit of the Vineyard, which he hath planted; 'tis but Reaſon: Inſtruments in the hand of the Lord, of tranſplanting others out of the wild Olive, into the good Olive, out of the putred ſtock, old <hi>Adam,</hi> into the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Root, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, may, by virtue of the Lord's Ordinance, eat of the Fruit of their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Vineyard, eat and drink with, and receive Neceſſaries from ſuch as they have gathered, to be fruitful Branches, lively Plants in their Plantation: No ground for Man-made Miniſters to force a Maintenance from thoſe that receive them not, who are not of their Plantation, their Vineyard: Let your own Vineyards maintain you.</p>
               <p>He that feeds a Flock may eat of the Milk of the Flock; but it muſt be of the Milk of that Flock, which he feeds: The Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, in the Word of Faith, Power and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gathered others into the Unity of Faith, to the holy Hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> theſe were Flocks, as Flocks of Sheep which come up from the Waſhing, whereof every one bears Twins, and none are barren; theſe they feed with convenient Food: <hi>And let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things,</hi> Gal. 6.6. This we own. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> The Law commanded, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzel the Mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</hi> Deut. 25.4. The Equity of the Law required, That the Ox that trod out the Corn, was not to be muzled, but be fed by him whoſe Corn he trod out: And 'twas not agreeable to the Equity of that Law, that while he trod out Corn for one man, another ſhould be forced to maintain him. 'Twas the Cuſtom of the Eaſt, and of <hi>Grecce,</hi> to uſe Oxen to tread out the Corn, before the Invention or Uſe of Flails: Niggards muzled them, that they might not eat thereof; this the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad: What implies all this? That Goſpel Miniſters may expect, and according to Chriſt's Ordinance receive a Goſpel Maintenance, from ſuch as receive them and their Doctrine; but not from ſuch as receive them not, nor their Miniſtry; that were all one, as if while the Ox trod out the Corn for one man, another man ſhould by Laws,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102409:26"/>Force, Penalties, have been compelled to feed the ſame. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes duly underſtood and conſider'd, aford no ground for Man-made Miniſters to force Tythe, or other Maintenance, from ſuch as receive them not; ſuch are not of their Flocks, ſuch receive not their Teaching, nor Sowing, nor Treading, as I may ſay; they come in another Name, Power and Virtue, who ſeparate and threſh out the pure Grain. <q>The Office of one truly called into the Miniſtry (ſaith <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi>) is expreſſed by threſhing, that thou mayſt not think that Miniſters ought to live in Idleneſs; and that thou mayſt not judge, that the Church is bound to maintain thoſe that are idle, who do not profit the Church.</q> So let your own Flocks maintain you; Force not a Maintenance from ſuch as receive you not, if you do, you tranſgreſs Chriſt's Ordinance, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Practice. Remember the Saying of one; <hi>Id quod noſtrum eſt, ſine facto noſtro avelli non poteſt:</hi> that is, That which is our own may not be taken from us, without our own Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking Wages of them, to do you Service,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.8.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Paul</hi> had power to eat and to drink, to receive carnal things of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſeeing he had ſown ſpiritual things unto them, yet he uſed not his Power for ſome Reaſons, but preached the Goſpel Freely unto them, and had a Free and Voluntary ſupply from the Brethren of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> while he was in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Service: Thus he received of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> to whom he had formerly preached, that he might not be chargeable to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This proves not Tythes nor a forced Maintenance from thoſe that received him not, but quite the contrary: This proves recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Freely of them to whom he had preached Freely; <hi>When I was preſent with you, and wanted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Brethren that came from</hi> Macedonia <hi>ſupplyed me,</hi> verſ. 9. And though he calls it Robbery, yet he received nothing but from ſuch as had received him and his Doctrine; and in this he tranſgreſſed not Chriſt's Ordinance; for the Maintenance of the Goſpel Miniſtry, the Brethren of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and of all the gathered Churches, made up the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of God; and for this Family to miniſter carnal Things to them, from whom they reaped ſpiritual things; the Royal Law requires it. <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> ſaid on this place, <q>As Conquerers pillage thoſe whom they conquer, ſo whatſoever <hi>Paul</hi> received of the Churches,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102409:27"/>which he had gained to Chriſt, it was the prey of his Conqueſts; although (ſaith he) <hi>Paul</hi> never received any thing but what they Freely miniſtred; and what they Freely miniſtred, it was, as it were, a Due or Debt, by reaſon of his ſpiritual Warfare.</q> So <hi>Paul</hi> receiving Neceſſaries from thoſe that received him, is no ground for Man-made Miniſters to force Tythe, and other Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from thoſe that receive him not; theſe Robbers are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature than <hi>Paul</hi> was. Yea, and this Self-denying Apoſtle ſaid further to theſe <hi>Corinthians, That he would not be burthenſom unto them; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 'Twas their Souls, not their Wealth, their Salvation, not their Gold that he ſought after. <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> ſaid on this place, <q>That it is the concern of a true Teacher, not to ſeek Gain from his Sheep, but the Welfare of the Sheep.</q> But Man-made Miniſters have not the Mind of <hi>Paul,</hi> regard the Fleece more than the Flock.</p>
               <p>A Cloud of Examples might be produced out of the Writings of the Apoſtles, ſhewing, their exact walking according to Chriſt's Command, in referance to Free and Voluntary Contributions, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>Further, 'tis evident, that at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thereabouts, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were ſo influenced in the Apoſtles days, and ſuch Openneſs and Unity was among them, that all things were in Common; ſuch as were Poſſeſſors of Lands or Houſes, ſold them, and laid the Prices thereof at the Apoſtles Feet, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. For what end was that done? Not to enrich the Apoſtles, but that Diſtribution might be made to every man, according as he had need, that there might be no want in the Family of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, That the Church gathered at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> by <hi>Mark,</hi> follow the ſame Rule as the Saints did at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> through mutual Love eſtabliſhed in that Nearneſs, Openneſs and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as to have all things Common, <hi>Hieron. in vita Marc.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſuch as received them, through the Croſs of Chriſt grew up in the alforming Word of Life, they bluſtered not about <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> earthly Things, as Worldlings do; they knew the End of the World, a bleſſed Knowledge, ſurmounting the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Spoiling Philoſophers.</p>

                  <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi> entertaining a ſerious Conſideration of the Primitive Unanimity, Oneneſs of Mind, and of the great Degeneration of his Age, brake out into theſe Expreſſions; <hi>Now our Hearts are harder then Iron, who are no more affected with the reading of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, than the faithful gave liberally of their own: We at this day are not content niggardly to keep in what we have of our own, but we cruelly greedy after other mens,</hi> In Acta 4.35. A Diſeaſe too Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical in this Age.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus, as I ſaid before, ordained a Maintenance for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, which was Free and Voluntary, from ſuch as received them; by his Ordinance, they neither could, neither ever did, force a Maintenance from thoſe that received them not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Paul,</hi> who had the Mind of Chriſt, in purſuance of Chriſt's Ordinance, ſeeing many convinced and converted, the Family of the Lord much increaſed, through the Labour of true Witneſſes, to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth; and ſeeing Neceſſities ariſing, and through the Enmity of the Dragon, encreaſing, he ordained a Weekly Collection; ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now concerning the Collections for the Saints; as I have given order to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>even ſo do ye; upon the Firſt day of the Week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. wherein every man was to give, according as he purpoſed in his Heart, 2 Cor. 9.1, 5, 7. And theſe Free and Voluntary Collections and Contributions were put into the hands of the Deacons, men of honeſt Report, full of the holy Ghoſt, and of Wiſdom; who out of this Stock and Treaſury, were to ſupply and relieve the Neceſſities of all Indigent and Wanting Brethren: Hereby all the Services and Neceſſities of the Church were ſupplied; <hi>Poole, Zegerus, Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Maintenance of the Goſpel Miniſtry was Free and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, by ſuch as received them: And this was Chriſt's Ordinance by the Mouth of his choſen Veſſel <hi>Paul,</hi> for the Supply of poor and indigent Brethren, and other Uſes and Services of the Church, even of <hi>Paul,</hi> who had the Mind of Chriſt, who ſaid to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, That he had kept nothing back that was profitable to them; and that he had declared unto them the whole
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102409:28"/>Counſel of God:</hi> Yet no man reads that he ever taught or ordained any other Maintenance of the Goſpel Miniſtry &amp; Indigent Brethren, than by Free, Spontaneous and Voluntary Contribution; this he preached up, who kept back nothing profitable, but declared the whole Counſel of God: So that he left no place of divine Right, for any other Maintenance, than what he had already declared.</p>
               <p>Now the Locuſts crawling out of the Smoke of the Pit, Man-made Miniſters having nothing but natural Qualifications and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, they account this Goſpel Maintenance, by Free and Voluntary Contribution, as <hi>Beggarly and Baſe, as Contemptible and Diſhonourable;</hi> ſo kicks <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ordinance out of place, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as I may ſay, and introduces and conſtitutes a more Stately, Authorative, Commanding Ordinance of their own, exacting and extorting a Maintenance by Compulſion, not ſparing their own Flocks, nor others, contrary to Chriſt's Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now, I am herein confident, and bold to affirm, That theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away this Ordinance of VOLUNTARY Contribution, and in the room thereof forcibly intruding the Compulſive exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tythes, and any other Anti-evangelical Maintenance, are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Curſe pronounced by the Mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>If any man preach any other Goſpel, than that ye have received, let him be Anathema, Accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilſon,</hi> in his compleat Chriſtian-Dictionary, bears full, lively and pregnant Evidence hereunto; ſaying, <hi>The Miniſters of the primitive Church were maintained by the Free and Voluntary Benevolence of the People, whoſe zeal and love to the Goſpel were ſo fervent, that they were ready to part with all, for the Maintenance of it: But the zeal of theſe later dayes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any at all, is ſo cold, that moſt men will not part with a Nut-ſhell unto the Miniſters, but what they are forced unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He bears a true Teſtimony to the primitive Practice and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and likewiſe implies, That the neceſſity of forcing a Maintenance is among ſuch, and only ſuch, whoſe zeal and fervency to the Goſpel is quenched, through the prevailing power of Iniquity, ſtreams of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Yet Man-made Miniſters now are ſo fired with the Love of the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs, as that they Diſpute, Jangle and Contend againſt the primitive Ordinance of Free and Voluntary Contribution, and corrupt Scriptures by the intermixture of their

               <p>While the Church was under Perſecution by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, it remained in much Purity of Doctrine and Converſation; a time of Sufferings is a time of Seriouſneſs: But <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great embracing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> his Empire turned <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the Lump; whether Nominal or Real, let the Wiſe in Heart judge; the Fan being over, Carnal ſecurity, Eaſe, Pride, Covetouſneſs and Ambition grew up in the Garden of the Church.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding the Example, Doctrine and Threats of the aforeſaid, and others, it was not a generally received Doctrine, that Tythe ought to be paid, till about the Year 800. <hi>Agobard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons; Selden</hi> of Tythe.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop for the moſt part in theſe Ages, lived in ſome Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and his Clergy with him, from whence he ſent them into the Country within his Dioceſs to Preach, and they brought all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings they received into the Common Treaſury, out of which, the Neceſſities of the Biſhops, Prieſts, Poor, Diſtreſſed, Sick, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, were ſupplied and relieved; places for publick Aſſemblies, called Churches, were built and repaired: the Prieſts then had not ſuch a particular Intereſt in the Free and Voluntary Offerings, as after they uſurped.</p>
               <p>About the Year 800, 900, 1000. and after, Tythes were called the Lord's Goods, the Patrimony of the Poor, Tributes of poor Souls, Stipends of the Poor, of Strangers: Hereupon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Nants</hi> declared, That the Clergy was not to uſe them as their own, but as commended to their truſt: And they were not then given particularly to the Clergy, but for the uſe and relief of the Poor.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In theſe Dayes People being brought to believe that their Tythe ought to be given for the uſe of the Poor, as the the firſt Preachers up of Tythe held out, they were more deſirous to give them to the Poor, then to the Prieſt; at length the foul and loathſome Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Covetouſneſs ſo far infected the Clergy, as that Prieſts (through the Auxiliaries, or Aſſiſtants of Popes and Councils) quite ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Poor and Needy, and ſeized upon the Whole, as rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Vulters ſeize on their Prey.</p>

               <p>The Doctrine of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, about the Year 1200. relating to pluck the Bread out of the Mouth of the Poor, and to give it to the Prieſt, ſounded ſweetly in the Prieſts Ears.</p>

Certainly this Doctrine could not but aſtoniſh and amaze the People, concluding them Hainous Offenders, for the obſervance of that which had for Generations been Preached up as Meritorious: Is there not occaſion given to cry out,
<q>
                     <l>—Quid non mortalia pectora cogis,</l>

               <p>Further, a General Council held at <hi>Lyons</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth, in the Year 1274. Conſtituted, that thenceforth it ſhould not be lawful for men to give their Tythes where they would, as it had been before, but that they ſhould pay all their Tythes to the Mother-Church: Hence 'tis evident that People might diſpoſe of their Tythes as they pleaſed, till they were reſtrained by Popes, and Popiſh Councils.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> under Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, about the Year 1560. commanded, that all Men of what degree and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever, who were lyable to pay Tythes, ſhould juſtly pay the ſame, after that time, to the Cathedral Church, or to any other Church, or Perſon, to whom the ſame was of right due: This is the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> (as I may ſay) the great Decree, directly conſtituting Tythes, all, or moſt of what was before ſuppoſed them as due by ſome former right.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ethelbert</hi> gave him and them a Meeting, who advanced for their Standard a Silver Croſs, and the painted Image of Chriſt, ſinging the ſolemn Litanies, &amp;c. <hi>Ethelbert</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Fair and ample are the Promiſes which you bring; yet ſuch as being new and uncertain, I cannot haſtily aſſent unto: Nevertheleſs becauſe you are Strangers, and are come afar to impart unto us the Knowledge of things, which doubtleſs you judge the trueſt and beſt, we will not recompence you with any Moleſtation, but will Friendly entertain you; nor do we forbid, whom you can by Preaching, to gain to your Belief.</hi> He allotted them a Reſidance in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his chief City. <hi>Milton.</hi>

               <p>A great part of the Nation being in a little time brought to the Romiſh Faith, they began to with-draw from their Dependance and Reliance upon the Free and Voluntary Contributions of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and began to preach up the old <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine; That Tythes ought to be paid, and that Pardon of Sins might be merited, the Torments of Hell avoided by ſuch good Works: Thus the Poor, Depraved, Deluded, Seduced and Ignorant People, through the Sorceries of their Pollitick Leaders, the Prieſts, were drawn to the Voluntary Contribution of theis Tythes, or of what portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they pleaſed, to Monaſteries, Nunneries, Abbeys, Monks, Nuns, Abbots, Priors, Prioreſſes, Hoſpitals, Poor, &amp;c. Which Donations at length were confirmed by the Canon Law; and ſuch as had not Voluntarily beſtowed their Tythe, they were forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by Laws and Statutes; and a general Exaction thereof through the whole Kingdom was eſtabliſhed upon the Clergy.</p>
               <p>In this Mid-night of Popery, Tythe or Tenths were accounted the Souls Ranſome, and preached ſo to be by the covetous Clergy; ſo that in the Belief hereof, People gave not only Tythes, but Lands alſo to Religious Houſes, ſo called. Who would deny the Soul's
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102409:34"/>Ranſom, Endleſs Life, if ſo to be purchaſed? In the Belief of this Doctrine, the Clergy had almoſt gotten the third part of the Land; and but that the Law againſt Mortmain prevented, might ſtrangely have prevailed by further Encroachments.</p>
               <p>Now in order to owe People to be devout and exact in the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythe, they tell us a Miracle thereto, relating, how that <hi>Auſtin at a certain time coming to a place called</hi> Cometon, <hi>to preach, the Prieſt of the place made complaint againſt the Lord of the Mannor, for detaining his Tythe; for which thing</hi> Auſtin <hi>Excommunicated him; and ſaying Maſs as the Altar, forbad Excommunicated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be preſent thereat: Preſently a dead Corps, buried One Hundred and Seventy years before, aroſe out of his Grave, and ſtood afar off, during the Celebrating of holy Maſs.</hi> Auſtin <hi>asked him what he was? He ſaid,</hi> He was a man that in his Life-time would never pay Tythe to the Prieſt, ſo was excommunicated; and dying, went to Hell for that Crime. Auſtin <hi>raiſed the dead Prieſt, who affirmed,</hi> That that man would never pay his Tythe. Auſtin <hi>ſent the live dead Corps to his Grave again; ſaying,</hi> He had ſuffered long in Hell, <hi>that is, in</hi> Purgatory. <hi>The Lord of the Mannor ſeeing all this, was much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and fell at</hi> Auſtin<hi>'s feet, confeſſing his Fault; became a due Payer of his Tythe all his Life-time; John</hi> de Grand ſono, <hi>Johan.</hi> Anglici Hiſtoria Aurea.</p>
               <p>Such Deluſions as theſe, as alſo the Doctrine of Merits, and of Tythe being the Souls Ranſom, being received by the Credulous, Deluded <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings in their reſpective Kingdoms of the Heptarchy, and in their reſpective Reigns, made Laws and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees for the due Payment of Tythes.</p>

               <p>ACcording to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpenſation, a portion of firſt ripe Fruits were offered unto the Lord; and this did Sanctifie the Remainder of Fruits; and by theſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were raiſed up into hopes of enjoying their whole Crop in due Seaſon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29.

Yea, and <hi>John</hi> called the Hundred Forty and Four Thouſand, who ſtood on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lamb, <hi>The firſt Fruits unto God, and to the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14.4.</p>
               <p>Thus in Goſpel dayes, the Jewiſh firſt Fruits were not preached up, but Chriſt the End thereof, the End of the firſt Covenant, firſt Prieſthood, and its Typical Appurtenances, even Chriſt, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical firſt Fruits.

               <p>Though it was long e're the Pope brought to paſs his Attempt of Tenths to himſelf, from all his inferiour Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> yet at laſt it was effected: Yea, and the Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhew, that there was no little ſtrugling by Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament againſt firſt Fruits, calling the ſame, <hi>An Horrible Miſchief, and a Damnable Cuſtom:</hi> Yet not ſo Horrible, Miſchievous or Damnable, but the Pope would receive them, and Man-made Miniſters preach them up.</p>
               <p>The Payment of firſt Fruits and Tenths were continued to the Pope, as annexed to his Chair, as Succeſſor to the Jewiſh high-Prieſt, Head of the Church, till the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, who then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Popes Supremacy, and aſſumed it to himſelf; and by Act of Parliament got firſt Fruits and Tenths annexed to his Crown: Thus the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Types and Figures were received from hand to hand, entertained among the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; which thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duely conſider'd, is Antichriſtian, a Denyal of Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh.

               <p>IN the Mid-night of Popery, Prieſts begot in People a Belief, that their Prayers, Maſs-Services, Obits, &amp;c. were wonderful effectual to bring the Souls of the deceaſed out of Purgatory: So 'twas appointed, that the Relict, the Wife of the Deceaſed, was to pay ten Shillings more or leſs to the Prieſt; and this was called a <hi>Mortuary. And why muſt ſhe pay ſo much to the Prieſt?</hi> That the Prieſt might pray for the Soul of her Deceaſed Husband; and that ſome of their Merits, which they had in ſtore, might be ſhared out to him; pretending, <hi>They had a ſtock of Merits to ſell, to ſuch as came with Money in their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selden</hi> mentions a Synod in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein it appears, that a man might have bequeathed his Burial to what Abbey he would; and that the Abbot thereof ſhould have his Apparel, his Horſe and his Cow for a Mortuary, although he had before beſtowed all he had upon another Abbot.</p>
               <p>Now the Pope being denyed, and a Reformation intended, the Clergy concluded, that it was groſs and idolatrous to receive Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries upon ſuch a Conſideration; and yet unwilling to part with ſuch a ſweet Morſel, deviſed a more plauſible conſideration, and that was, That Mortuaries ſhould be given in Recompence of Tythes, not duely paid in the Life-time; not conſidering, that in this very thing, they condemn all their Hearers, as Fraudulent and Deceitful, ſo muſt have a Recompence for the Fraud, Guile, &amp; Unjuſt detaining of Church-dues in their Life-time. The Apoſtles practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch thing, but bare Teſtimony, <hi>That men ſhould ariſe, ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Covetous Practiſes.</hi> 'Tis a ſhame, that <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo called, from proteſting to renounce Popery, ſhould be ſo defiled and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with ſuch Covetous Practices.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, 'twas enacted, <hi>That the Biſhops of</hi> Bangor, Landaff, <hi>and St</hi> Aſſaph, <hi>and the Arch-Deacon of</hi> Cheſter,

                  <hi>ſhould take Mortuaries of the Prieſts, within their Juriſdictions;</hi> as had been accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Henry</hi> enacted, <hi>That no Mortuary ſhould be demanded where the Goods of the dead Perſon (Debts deducted) amount not to the value of ten Marks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

By this Satanical Stratagem and Deluſion, almoſt a third part of the whole Land was hooked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aforeſaid Houſes and Clergy; and there was no cry heard among the Ravenous Cormorants, <hi>'Tis Enough,</hi> but rather the Horſleeches Language, <hi>Give, Give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that all the Land might not be ſwallowed up in this unſatiable Whirle-Pool, a Statute againſt Mortmain, that is, againſt the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation of Lands, to ſuch and ſuch Uſes was provided.</p>

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in his great Charter to all Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Sheriffs, &amp;c. enacted thus: <q>If any from henceforth give his Lands to any Religious Houſe, and thereupon be convict, the Gift ſhall be utterly void, and the Land ſhall accur to the Lord of the Fee. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt enacted to the ſame purpoſe.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth confirmed this in the 23d year of his Reign, enacting, <q>That Aſſurances of Lands to Churches, Chappels, Church-wardens, Guilds, Fraternities, Commonalties, &amp;c. made of Devotion, as to the Uſes and intents, to have Obits perpetual, or a continual Service of a Prieſt forever, or for ſixty or eighty Years, were as Prejudicial to the Lords, as if they were aliened in Mortmain, ſo to be void.</q>
               </p>

               <p>Now the Pope having brought in Tythes, and appointed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould receive them; notwithſtanding his general Decree, yet he, in favour to his chiefeſt Props and Cathedral Pillars, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently granted Exemptions to ſuch and ſuch Orders, whereby they became freed of the payment of Tythes, as to the Templers, Ciſtercians, Hoſpitallers, and generally to all Lands held by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perſons and Houſes; upon this account, who have bought the

               <p>YOu that are, or would be accounted Goſpel-Miniſters, and plead that Chriſt hath granted you Tythes for your Maintenance; yet can neither tell where nor when. Let me tell you, if you have Chriſt's Ordinance and Inſtitution for Tythe, then no Cuſtom, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, Preſcription, priviledge or Popiſh Diſpenſation, can juſtly acquit any from the payment of the utmoſt penny of the tenth part; for Ordinances and Doctrines of Chriſt are not to be made void by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102409:42"/>the Injunctions of men: How comes Lay-men, Impropriators to be ſuch ſharers in Tythe, which is your right as Goſpel-Miniſters, as you pretend? Are they not Sacrilegious therein? And how come ſo many to be exempted from the payment of Tythe? But all this is but a Covetous pretence, Chriſt put an End to that Law which gave Tythe to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and eſtabliſhed a Free and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Maintenance for Goſpel-Miniſters without Tythe: And Tythes came into <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches by the Pope, and all Exemptions from the payment of Tythes were by the Pope's Indulgence. And now I ſhall declare what I have read concerning Tythes in the poſſeſſion of Lay-men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hunnes, Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> invaded <hi>Italy</hi> under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and greatly perſecuted all Religious men, overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, burnt Libraries, overthrew Schools of Learning; theſe fierce and barbarous People about the Year 650. ſet their Faces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France;</hi> upon this <hi>Charles Martell</hi> the Father of <hi>Pipin,</hi> after King of <hi>France,</hi> would not oppoſe himſelf againſt them, unleſs the under Clergy of <hi>France</hi> would reſign every man his Tythes into his Hands, that thereby he might reward the Souldiers, and ſupport the Charges of the War then preſent; he ſolemnly promiſed that theſe Tythes ſhould be reſtored to them at the end of the War, with a further Gratuity for their good Will, the Clergy driven thereto by the Exigences of that Age, and eminent Dangers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with theſe motions: This <hi>Charles Martell</hi> having driven out and overthrown theſe barbarous Nations, performed not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with the Clergy, but divided their Benefices to ſuch of the Nobility as had done Valiantly in that Enterprize, and aſſured the ſame to them and their Heirs forever in Fee; The Example hereof paſſed over the Alpes into <hi>Italy,</hi> and mounted above the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhortly failed over into <hi>England.</hi> Thus Tythes came out of the Hands of the Clergy, and became the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Laity. This Fact of <hi>Martellus</hi> was committed about the Year 660. and for it is confidently Damn'd in the <hi>Legend;</hi> the Story of his Damnation is faſtened upon <hi>Euchere,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who is ſaid, to have ſeen in a Viſion this <hi>Martellus</hi> in Hells Torment, and that <hi>Euchere</hi> might believe what he ſaw, an Angel inſtructed him to ſeek for <hi>Martell</hi> in his Sepulchre; ſo he did, but found him not, but the place he found all black, and inſtead of <hi>Martell</hi> a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102409:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>Serpent. This Story is to be read in the <hi>Legend,</hi> and the whole paſſage is Recorded by Sr. <hi>Thomas Ridley,</hi> in his view of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Law.</p>
               <p>Further, how it came to paſs, that Tythes appointed by man for the Maintenance of the Clergy, for the uſe of the Poor, for the building and repairing of places of publick Worſhip, came into the Hands of Lay-men, as they are called, <hi>Albius Krantzius</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and King of <hi>France,</hi> through his compliance with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> he firſt got the Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian-King;</hi> he Conquered the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and drew them from <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> to the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and made Proviſion for the Clergy. <q>But 'tis ſaid (ſaith this <hi>Krantzius</hi>) that Tythe at firſt was not aſſigned to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Clergy, but to the King's Lievetenants, that out of the ſame they might pay their Souldiers, and anſwer the Charge of the frequent expeditions againſt that Nation. For this end (ſaith his Chronicle) in <hi>Saxony</hi> and other places, much Tythes were in the Hands of Lay-men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſame <hi>Krantzius</hi> renders anothers Cauſe; the Clergy fearing that Princes would not ſecure them in their Poſſeſſion of Tythes, he ſuppoſes the Clergy gave them part of Tythe, thereby to obliege them, to ſecure them in their Poſſeſſion of their reſpective parts, chuſing rather to loſe part thereof, then the whole: and that the things are true which <hi>Krantzius</hi> relates, 'tis evident from that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt Emperor made, ſaying, <hi>As touching you, O Biſhops, the Pope judges it an unfitting thing that Tythes which are dedicated to Altars, and Church-men, ſhould be in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Lay-men; neither will he underſtand, that Churches of Old ſuffering great afflictions, were defended by Lay-men; than Church-men, as a recompence to Lay-men, gave them part of their large Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Tythes.</hi> Kran. Lib. 1. and Lib. 6. <hi>Noviſſima Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in our Nation, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth ſhaking off the Pope, denying his Supremacy, he diſſolved many Monaſteries, which had many Tythes and Rectories appropriated unto them; ſo kept part in his own Hands, part he ſold to others, to be held as Lay-Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions; thus they dropt into Lay-mens hands, and theſe Lay-men having no Law to recover them; the Popes Law not reaching to Lay-perſons, ſo called, this <hi>Henry</hi> made new Laws in behalf of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102409:43"/>Lay-men, that they might be capacitated to enforce the aforeſaid payment of Tythes. Thus it appears what jumbling and Confuſion hath been in the Night of Apoſtacy to introduce and continue Tythes, granted only to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their Service under that Miniſtration; which Law, which Service, and which Maintenance Chriſt, the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> put an end unto; and ſuch as introduce what he put an end unto; notwithſtanding their gilded Colours and ſpecious Pretences, being ſeen in Gods Eye, and weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, they are found Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>Now you Teachers of what Denomination ſoever, who ſtrive, ſtruggle and wreſtle, to maintain a property in your delicate and dainty Morſell Tythes, and that <hi>jure divino, aut humano,</hi> by divine or humane Right; give me leave ſoberly and modeſtly to make tryal of your Right to, or Property in the ſame, in your moſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental pretences: and to the end I may Methodize the enſuing diſcourſe, let me lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree, try your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tenure of right unto the exaction of Tythes, and that from a four-fold Authority, Patriarchal, Moſaical, Evangelical and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; for all Grounds, Reaſons and Arguments that are, or can be alledged for the exaction of Tythes, are naturally reducible to one or other of theſe four Sourſes or Springings; and if theſe main Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Cathedral props, cannot bear up that Building of the exaction of Tythes in Goſpel Dayes, and that by Divine right, it will and ought to tumble down, as the Reformation of the great Goſpel-Reformer prevails in Churches profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and as you learn the ſound, wholſom and ſavoury Leſſon of Self-denyal, you will be glad and rejoyce for the Reformation of Chriſt, and for the increaſe of his Government; notwithſtanding your loſs of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Proviſion.</p>

Now where is the Command that Tythes ſhould be paid to <hi>Melchizedec?</hi> Where is the Law of the Aſſignation of them to him? 'Tis not groundleſs Conjectures and Suppoſitions will ſerve the turn; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Precept is called for: No right could be derived from <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi> to another, which was not firſt in <hi>Melchizedec</hi> himſelf; <hi>

               <p>Obj. <hi>Tythes were paid to</hi> Melchizedec, <hi>after whoſe Order Chriſt was High Prieſt forever, therefore due unto the Evangelical Order.</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102409:44"/>but he paid Tythes: The <hi>Geneva</hi> notes on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.5. ſay, The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> had Commandment to receive that which <hi>Abram</hi> gave free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Melchizedes.</hi> What <hi>Abram</hi> did it was Free and Voluntary, <hi>Melchizedec</hi> had no Law to require it, neither had <hi>Abram</hi> a Law enjoyning him to pay it; neither is it apparent that ever <hi>Abram</hi> gave the Tythe but this once, upon this accidential or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential occaſion, which may be taken for a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, and a return of kindneſs to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> who had given him Bread and Wine for the Refreſhment of him and his Souldiers after the Fight: A voluntary Promiſe only binds the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer; and the free Gift of one is not obligatory to others, no binding Example for future Generations, a feeble Ground for ſuch as would be accounted Goſpel-Miniſters to claim Tythe; if <hi>Abram's</hi> free and voluntary Gift muſt be a binding Rule in Goſpel-dayes, then may every man require Bread and Wine of their Prieſt, for the refreſhment of themſelves and Families, every Officer require the ſame for himſelf and Souldiers; the one Example is as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as the other in Goſpel-Dayes, both being Voluntary.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102409:45"/>accounts, as alſo our Country-man <hi>Poole,</hi> ſay expreſly, That <hi>Abram</hi> gave him Tythes, not of his own Lands and Flocks, but of the Spoils taken from the Enemy. <hi>Poole</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. ſaith, <q>This place cannot be underſtood of all <hi>Abram</hi>'s Poſſeſſions, but of all the Spoil taken in that Battle.</q> 
                  <hi>Abram</hi> was not then at Home, but in his Journey in his return from the purſuit of his Enemy. Now if you will have Tythe from this Example, you muſt go to the Souldiers, and make your claim after Victories obtained; for <hi>Abram</hi> gave not the Tythes of his own Lands and Flocks, nor ever, but this once, as far as appears. How then proves this a yearly payment of Tythes to Goſpel-Miniſters? And how can an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al payment be juſtly derived to others from the free and voluntary Gift of one, and that but once?</p>
               <p>Again, if from the Gift of <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> you will enforce any thing to that Order; it can but be free Gift, which we deny not, in the Wiſdom of God, being ordained of Chriſt, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Apoſtles and Churches, while a pure Virgin to Chriſt; ſo that your Antiquity of Tythes to the Goſpel-Miniſtry, is vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the free Gift of the People.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>To give and to pay is all one in this Caſe: So the Apoſtle not only ſaid, he gave the Tenth,</hi> Heb. 7.4. <hi>but alſo</hi> Levi <hi>paid Tythe in</hi> Abram, <hi>verſe</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To give and to pay is not all one in this Caſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the Wiſdom of God varied his Expreſſion, according to the Perſons he treated of, and the different Times and Seaſons he related to, ſpeaking of <hi>Abram</hi> in the Anti-<hi>Levitical</hi> dayes, before Tythes were commanded, in whom it was a free, voluntary, ſpontaneous Act, Gift to <hi>Melchizedec;</hi> he ſays, He gave (but ſpeaking of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi>) of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, who lived after Tythes were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and commanded to be paid; he expreſſes himſelf by the word Paid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Abram</hi> Gave, <hi>Levi</hi> Paid: That <hi>Abram</hi> came thither with an intention to Pay, or <hi>Melchizedec</hi> with an expectation to receive Tythes, I cannot receive.</p>
               <p>Now that Tythe was not Paid to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> but Given, and that not Yearly, but once, and that not of the Increaſe of his Lands and Flocks, but of the Pillage of <hi>Sodom</hi> reſcued and recovered from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102409:45"/>the Plunderers, the Fruits of War-like performances, 'tis very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Scripture is not dubious, but clear in this point; So they may be judged Irrational, who claim a property in, and plead for Tythes upon ſuch crazy and feeble grounds.</p>
               <p>Jacob's <hi>Vow conſidered,</hi> Gen 28.22. <hi>being ſtoutly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the continuance of Tythes in Goſpel-dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Journey from <hi>Beerſheba</hi> to <hi>Haran,</hi> tarried all Night in a certain place, and laid down to ſleep, with his Head upon a Pillow of Stones; and from the Lords glorious appearance unto him, and ſweet &amp; comfortable Promiſe of his preſence with him, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and that in him and in his Seed, all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, he called the Name of that place <hi>Bethel,</hi> by Interpretation, <hi>The Houſe of God;</hi> in the fence of theſe things, and in confidence of the Lord's Promiſe and faithful performance, he vowed, ſaying, <hi>If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me Bread to eat, and Rayment to put on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this Stone which I have ſet for a Pillar, ſhall be God's Houſe, and of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the Tenth unto thee,</hi> Gen. 28. This <hi>Jacob</hi> performed after twenty Years; as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> ſaith in theſe Words, <hi>By Offering unto the Lord the Tenth of all his Subſtance which he got at</hi> Haran. After that he returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place, where God's appearance unto him was.</p>
               <p>This Vow of <hi>Jacob</hi> was Voluntary, in being unrequired: Let ſuch as would ſqueeze a Divine right to the exaction of Tythes from this, or from any <hi>Ante-diluvian,</hi> or <hi>Poſt-diluvian</hi> Patriarch, ſhew a command for the ſame, before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Aſſignation; the known Maxime is, <hi>Affirmanti incumbit probatio;</hi> that is, He that affirms, muſt prove, being Voluntary: 'Tis no binding Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to future Generations; though 'tis true, <hi>Jacob's</hi> Vow was obligatory to him, after he had vowed, but not to his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the eleaven Tribes paid not Tythes to <hi>Levi,</hi> by reaſon of the Example of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> voluntary Gifts, but by vertue of the Lord's command thereunto enjoyning: That the Patriarchal Age was without a Divine command for the payment of Tythes; <hi>Pareus</hi> on the aforeſaid Scripture clearly demonſtrates, ſhewing, and ſaying, <hi>Decimae ante legem liberae erant &amp; arbitrariae, exemple A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brami &amp; Jacobi, licebat dare vovere, aut non;</hi> that is, Tythes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102409:46"/>the Law were free and arbitrary, by the example of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> a man might give them, Vow them, or not, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Now if there had been a Command for the ſame, they ought to have been paid, becauſe commanded; and they could not have been detained without breach of the Lord's command; <hi>Bernard</hi> touched this well, <hi>Non attendit vere pius, quale ſit illud, quod prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur, hoc Solo contentus quia praecipitur;</hi> that is, One truly Godly heeds not, or diſputes not, what like the thing is which is commanded, acquieſcing and contenting himſelf in that it is commanded.</p>
               <p>Again, as <hi>Jacob's</hi> Vow was Voluntary, ſo it was conditional in depending on the performance of Gods promiſe to him, if Tythes had been a divine Tribute, commanded of God, there had been no neceſſity of Vowing to give them, he could not have detained them, without the ſoul ſpot and ſordid blemiſh of Diſobedience; neither could he have made his Obligation conditional; for Tythes muſt have been paid, becauſe commanded. So this free, voluntary and ſpontaneous Vow conduces not to make up a Divine right to Tythes.</p>
               <p>Now if you will claim property in, and right unto Tythes from the voluntary Act of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> why do you not uſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, erect Altars, offer Sacrifice? Theſe things they did, and you have as much ground from their Example to perpetuate the reſt, as Tythes in Goſpel-dayes; and if the Smoke of <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Levites</hi> out of their Tythes were to offer up an Heave-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to the Lord, even the tenth part of their Tythe, and give it unto <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt for himſelf and his Sons; and this was all the portion the Prieſt had in Tythe, even the Tenth of the tenth from the Hands of the <hi>Levites;</hi> the <hi>Levites,</hi> Strangers, Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Widows had the reſt.</p>
               <p>So the Lord Inſtituted Three Tenths.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Tenths of the <hi>Levites,</hi> they had all the tenth in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Service of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21.</item>
                  <item>2dly, The Prieſts Tenths, which was the tenths of the <hi>Levites</hi> tenths, by them given to the Prieſt, to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons; this was called a Heave-Offering, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.26. &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3dly, The Poor man's Tythe at the end of three Years laid up within their Gates, and this was for the Relief and Maintenance of the Fatherleſs, Widow and Stranger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.27, 28.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as hath been touched, had no more right unto, nor Title in Tythes, then any of the other Tribes, till the Lord aſſigned the ſame to them; upon the Command they became due, and not to be detained while the Law was in force.</p>
               <p>Now you that perochially Officiate as Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; would be ſo accounted, yet have recourſe to the Authority of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for your Maintenance: Let me know how Goſpel Ordinances, peculiar to the Church of Chriſt, are to be practiſed, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Authority from a <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Seeing nothing can give priviledge unto a Goſpel property, but a Goſpel Authority, then why do you, pretending to be Miniſters of Chriſt, impoſe upon <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Bondage of a <hi>Moſaical</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to wit, the exaction of Tythes, whoſe Inſtitution and Beeing was from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and terminated with the Service it was given for?</p>
               <p>Again, if a Goſpel-Ordinance muſt be practiſed from <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitutions; Is not this to make the Goſpel ineffectual, of leſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then the Law, Chriſt inferior to <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Ordinances inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and not obligatory, unleſs ſtrengthned by the Authority of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102409:47"/>
                  <hi>Moſes?</hi> Undoubtedly to demand Tythes under the Goſpel, by vertue of the Inſtitution of <hi>Moſes,</hi> cannot want foul Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>In Relation to Tythes ſeveral things are further to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were commanded to be paid to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle; no other Tribe could claim property in the ſame, becauſe the Command reached only unto <hi>Levi:</hi> and it is the command of God that gives a Divine right unto a thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So if you will have Tythes from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Authority, you muſt prove your ſelves to be the very Perſons to whom they were commanded to be paid; you muſt prove your ſelves the Legitimate Sons of, and lineally deſcended from <hi>Levi;</hi> and if you will have the Wage of the <hi>Levites,</hi> you muſt do their Work, you muſt have an outward Tabernacle, and Veſſels thereto belonging, bear it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about it, take it down, ſet it up; For this and ſuch like Work Tythe was given to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and none of you muſt enter that Service till twenty five Years old, nor continue therein after the Age of Fifty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tythes, according to the Inſtitution of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were to be paid by the eleaven Tribes only, from their ſeveral Portions in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not any other People, nor any other place were bound by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the payment thereof. <hi>Euſebius</hi> agrees with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors and Rabbies herein, that Tythes were only limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> therefore if you will have the <hi>Levites</hi> Wage, you muſt not only prove your ſelves <hi>Levites,</hi> and do their Work, but you muſt go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and call for Tythes of the eleven Tribes; elſe prove <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof the eleven Tribes, which will prove a matter of great difficulty: The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors conclude that regularly, no Inhabitants but of the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were to pay any by their Law: Where they live diſperſed in ſtrange Lands, they pay no Tythes now, both for want of their Temple, Prieſthood, as alſo for the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> that live in <hi>Canaan</hi> now pay none, for want of their Temple and Prieſthood. But you pretending to be Miniſters of Chriſt, who put an end to that Service, for which they were given, and to the Law which gave
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102409:47"/>them; you, I ſay, being neither <hi>Jews, Levites,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor have the Temple, nor the Prieſthood, nor the Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances thereof; yet require them by that Law, which never gave them to any other, but to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their Service, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſthood ſettled on <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, received no Tythes of Husbandmen, at the Hands of the eleven Tribes; all that they received was the tenth of the Tenths from the <hi>Levites;</hi> this was called a Heave-Offering: So the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>And verily they that are the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive the Office of the Prieſthood, have a Commandment to take Tythes of the People, according to the Law, that is, of their Brethren; though they come out of the Loins of</hi> Abraham, Heb. 7 5.</p>
               <p>Now if you claim Tythes from the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſthood, as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them, you muſt do <hi>Aarons</hi> Work, have holy Garments, an outward Breaſt-plate, an Ephod, a broidered Coat, a Mitre, two Onyx Stones, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thumim;</hi> you muſt have the Shoulder, the two Cheeks and the Maw, when an Ox or a Sheep is offered in Sacrifice, which muſt be done: Such as claim the Wage of <hi>Aaron,</hi> they muſt do the Work of <hi>Aaron;</hi> yet in ſo doing it were Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, becauſe Chriſt is come, the end of the Law, the end of that Prieſthood that received Tythes, the end of the Heave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythe, as well as of the Meat-Offering, Sin-Offering, Burnt-Offering, Treſpaſs-Offering, Wave-Offering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 14. Why were the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſts blamed, for that when any man offered Sacrifice, their Servant came while the Fleſh was in ſeething, with a three-toothed Fleſh-hook in his Hand, and ſtroke it into the Pan, Kettle, Cauldron or Pot, and all that the Fleſh-hook brought up, that was the Prieſts due? I Anſwer, this was charged as a Fault upon them, becauſe they did it without divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. Now if that Cuſtom was blame-worthy, which extended but to the compaſs of a Pan, Kettle, Pot or Cauldron; Shall that be allowable which reaches to the utmoſt corner of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if divine Inſtitution miniſter not allowance thereunto?</p>
               <p>Obj <hi>The Heave-Offering Tythes was given by a Statute forever; doth not this perpetuate the payment of Tythes in Goſpel-Dayes? Is not the Evangelical Diſpenſation comprehended within the Bounds of forever?</hi> Numb. 18.11, 19.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102409:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is, moſt of the Types and Shadows of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as Circumciſion, Temple, Paſſover, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſts, Offerings, the Trumpets of the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> were called Statutes forever; whereupon the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtickle hard for the perpetual and immutable Obligation of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for a perpetual and immutable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; and thou that pleads for the continuance of Tythes, from this, may by the ſame rule plead for the continuance of all, or moſt of the Shadows of the Law, which were given by Statutes forever. Further, this phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Forever,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Antiquitates Apoſtolica:</hi> When it is applied unto God, it denotes Eternity; but when to other things, it implies no more then a Periodical duration, limitted according to the mind of the Law-giver. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servant was to have his Ear bored through with an Awl, and he was to ſerve forever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. (which was but till the end of his Life) <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.40.</p>
               <p>Thus when Circumciſion, Temple, Offerings, as other Ritual and Tranſient Services of the Law, were called, Statutes forever; 'tis implyed thereby, they ſhould be a long time obligatory, until the time of the Meſſiah, in whoſe dayes the daily Sacrifices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were to be taken away, the Type giving place to the thing typified, the Shadow to the Subſtance; then <hi>Paul</hi> preached againſt Circumciſion, the Paſſover outward; <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned for bearing witneſs againſt the Temple: <hi>Paul</hi> preached up Chriſt, the one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, the End and Subſtance of all Jewiſh Offerings. Thus in the Life, Typical Shadows, though called Statutes forever, were teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt; and Chriſt is the End of the Heave-Offering-Tythe, as well as of all other typical and tranſient Offerings.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Types of the Law (ſaith <hi>Wilſon,</hi> in his compleat Chriſtian-Dictionary) are called Everlaſting, becauſe in Chriſt, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, the Subſtance of ſuch Types, they have a perpetual continuance.</q> Thus the Types were commanded by an Ordinance forever, to the Ever or Laſt Period of that tranſient Diſpenſation, to give way to Chriſt, the Subſtance, in whom the thing ſignified by the Type is continued, running parallel with the duration of the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, The <hi>Levites</hi> were not to exact above the allowed Portion, the <hi>Levitical</hi> Property and Right was bounded within a <hi>Levitical</hi> Compaſs; the Fatherleſs, Widows and Strangers had a property in Tythes, as well as the <hi>Levites,</hi> Deut. 14. But now, Counterfeit
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102409:48"/>
                  <hi>Levites</hi> encroaching, and uſurping the whole Tenths; yea, all things conſidered, even the ſixth or ſeventh part of the Kingdom; What is this but grievous Oppreſſion? An eating the Bread out of the Mouth of the Fatherleſs, Widows and Strangers? A taking away the Sheaf from the Hungry? <hi>Job</hi> 24.10. Now if this <hi>Levitical</hi> order of Tything muſt continue, Why ſhould not the Fatherleſs, Widows and Strangers come in and claim their Right? If that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, introduced in the Apoſtacy, muſt be continued, why ſhould not the Inheriters be thereto entituled? Why ſhould the Right and Portion of Fatherleſs, Widows and Strangers be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ravenous Cormorants? Your degeneration from the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Inſtitution is exceeding great: Many of you, I ſay, not all, not only diſdaining to be ranked with the <hi>Levitical</hi> Alms-men, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, Widows and Strangers, and ſeizing upon their Property, but extorting and exacting Dues, as you call them, from many that are Poor and Indigent.</p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories ſufficiently evidence, that after the falling away from the primitive Faith, Purity and Order, Tythes came to be preached up, and introduced under the ſpecious pretences of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Alms to the Poor: This Doctrine being complied with, and people having liberty to beſtow them where and on whom they pleaſed, they were much diſpoſed to give them to the Poor; at which thing Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, about the Year 1200. much ſtormed, and greatly complained. Yea, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being mindful of the Poor and Indigent, for whoſe ſakes Tythes were chiefly given, made divers Laws in the reign of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that a convenient portion of the Tythes ſhould be ſet a part for the Maintenance of the Poor of the Pariſh forever: Yea, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Year 1559. enjoyned, That all Parſons, Vicars, Penſionaries, Prebendaries, and other Beneficed men, ſhould diſtribute the fortieth part of their Benefices upon their poor Pariſhioners.</p>
               <p>Tythes formerly were accounted the Pariſh Goods, out of which the Prieſt was to receive a moderate Maintenance for himſelf, then as a Steward faithfully to diſtribute the reſt to the Pariſh-poor, that Pariſhes might be exempted of further Charge on that account: But ſelfiſh Prieſts, who under the ſpecious pretence of relieving the Poor, gradually wrought upon People to pay their Tythes by little
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102409:49"/>and little, to manifeſt their Boſom-intents, excluding the Poor, and leaving them to the Mercy of the Pariſh, they ſeized on the whole for their particular Uſes, notwithſtanding the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitution, providing for the Relief of Fatherleſs, Widows and Strangers, as well as for the Prieſt and <hi>Levite,</hi> that the Husband-man might be at no further Charge on that account; and notwithſtanding our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliamentary Laws, the Poor have loſt their Property: <hi>The weakeſt</hi> (as the Proverb is) <hi>goes to the Wall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet my intention is not by any thing here ſpoken, to juſtifie the ritual Obſervances of <hi>Moſes</hi> in Goſpel dayes, nor the Service and Maintenance of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts and <hi>Levites;</hi> Perfection could not be by the Levitical Prieſthood, made by a Law, which becauſe of its weakneſs and unprofitableneſs was diſſanulled, ſo to give way to the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> whoſe Prieſthood is unchangeable, who perfects forever ſuch as are ſanctified; yea, and the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Prieſthood, Work or Wage is Antichriſtian; but ſomething I have ſpoken to ſhew how far they are from the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Levitical diſpenſation, though they run thither for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the caſe of Tythes, though in Goſpel dayes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Antonius,</hi> the learned Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> ſaith, <q>Chriſt himſelf, though Lord of Heaven and Earth, and the fulneſs thereof, yet would not he be poſſeſſed of great Lands and Incomes; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not Tythes, though a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec,</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:102409:49"/>but while he went through Cities and Countries preaching the Goſpel, and his Diſciples with him, ſeveral Woman that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, as <hi>Mary Magdalen, Joanna, Suſanna,</hi> and others, did miniſter to him of their Subſtance, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. And in ſending out his Diſciples, he bad them not to receive Tythes, nor did he teach People to pay them, but he taught them to rely on their Converts for neceſſary Supplies; ſaying, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his Meat,</hi> De Repub. Eccleſ. lib. 9.</q> This Teſtimony is true and ſavoury.</p>
               <p>Now, if you will have Tythes to be yours, <hi>jure divino,</hi> by divine Right, you muſt prove your Authority from Chriſt, ſhew a Goſpel Ordinance for it; ſuch as pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt, ought to be content with what Chriſt allotted his Miniſters for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; if his Wages content you not, you are not his Servants; you are his Servants, whoſe Wages you receive: If you receive <hi>Moſes</hi> Wages, you are <hi>Moſes</hi> Servants, ſo muſt do his Work: Miniſters of Chriſt abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt; being Wiſdom's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they juſtifie Wiſdom, both her Call, Work and Wage; Chriſt, for Goſpel Work, ordained a Goſpel Wage; he that will juſtly claim the one, muſt of neceſſity do the other; all Equity to the Title of one, is founded in the Labour of the other.</p>
               <p>He that pretends Title to an Eſtate, by virtue of a civil Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, making his Claim from the Ground of Purchaſe, Heirſhip, Free-Gift, Civil-Office, 'tis requiſit, that he make good, prove, maintain his Claim by Humane Laws, being ſuitable to the Nature of his Claim: So, you that make claim to Tythes, by virtue of a ſpiritual Capacity, or religious Qualification, as being Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus, you ought to prove and maintain your Claim by divine Laws, as being ſuitable to the Nature of your Claim. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Apoſtles, influenced from above, to the Diſcharge of their living Concern, were to teach all that, and nothing but that which Chriſt commanded them, both in Relation to the Call, Work and Maintenance, peculiar to the Goſpel Diſpenſation. So, prove Tythes, and your Co-ercive Settled Maintenance by the Doctrine of Chriſt, elſe you tranſgreſs the royal Charter of Chriſt's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this Diſciples, Apoſtles, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees were <hi>Jews,</hi> under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Miniſtration, and they were bound to the payment thereof, while the Law that commanded the ſame was in force; when Chriſt ſpoke that he was not then offered up, nor the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances blotted out, nor nailed to the Croſs.

Here is an expreſs Repeal of that Law, by which the Aſſignation of Tythes was made to the Prieſts and Levites. Further, <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified, ſaying, <hi>There is verily a diſſanulling of the Commandment going before,</hi> verſ. 18. Here 'tis evident, the Prieſthood that took Tythes was changed, and the Law was repealed, and the Commandment diſſanulled, by which Tythes were aſſigned to them, and by which they received them. Now it remains, that you that would be accounted Goſpel Miniſters, do prove an Aſſignation of them by Chriſt, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus eſt;</hi> do this, and the work is done.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>The whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aug.

               <p>The Law forbad the outward <hi>Jew</hi> to wear a Garment mingled with Linnen and Woollen, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. Now ſuch as plead for Tythes in Goſpel dayes, they confound the Ordinances of the firſt and ſecond Covenant together, not keeping Tythes within the Bounds of its proper Miniſtration, but would have it in the ſecond Covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it belongs not.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>They which miniſter about holy things, that is, the</hi> Levites, <hi>live of the things of the Temple, that is, of Tythes: And they which wait at the Altar, that is, Jewiſh Prieſts, are partakers with the Altar, that is, Sacrifices and Oblations; Even ſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> From this (EVEN SO) Tything-Miniſters draw ſuch a ſpurious Conſequence, as to ſqueeze out a Pariety or Identity of Maintenance between the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood and Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; that is, that Goſpel Miniſters were and are to have the very ſame Maintenance, as by Tythes, &amp;c. as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> had; but theſe words clearly relate to the Maintenance which Chriſt had ordained, not to the Jewiſh Way, Manner, Means or Mode of Maintenance; in paraphraſing on theſe words, this clearly ariſes, that as the Jewiſh Prieſts and Levites lived of the Maintenance allowed of God, and peculiar unto them for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſo thoſe that preach the Goſpel muſt live of the Wage allowed of by the Goſpel, which was free and voluntary. Now ſuch as plead for Tythes, ſuch would live of the Law, of the Maintenance of the <hi>Levites;</hi> ſo are not content with Goſpel Allowance: Neither Chriſt nor the Apoſtles looked back unto the Levitical Wage.</p>
               <p>Freely to receive what was Freely given, by thoſe that received Chriſts Miniſters and their Meſſage, was the Proviſion that Chriſt aſſigned to his Miniſters, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>

               <p>Again, If Goſpel Miniſters muſt live Even ſo, that is, have the ſame Maintenance that the Jewiſh Prieſts and Levites had, then Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel muſt not have the Tenth, but the Tenth of the Tenth; they muſt alſo bring in and plead for Jewiſh Oblations, Burnt Offerings, Bloody Sacrifices, for even ſo the Jewiſh Prieſts lived, ſo deny Chriſt Jeſus, the one Offering; this unavoidably muſt be done, if this <hi>[Even So]</hi> imply an Identity or Pariety of Maintenance between the Levitical Prieſthood and Goſpel Miniſters, the which I deny.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>Behold, we have forſaken all, and followed thee; What ſhall we have?</hi> Mat. 19.27. Chriſt anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not, though there was an occaſion for it: If he either had or did intend to aſſign Tythes to his Miniſtry, I ſay, he anſwered him not with an <hi>Even ſo</hi> as the Levitical Prieſthood had: He ſaid not, Are you ignorant of this? as my Father aſſigned Tythes to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their Service, ſo I aſſign them to you for your Service; neither ſaid he, You ſhall have Eaſter-Reckonings, Midſummer-Dues, Mortuaries, Money for Funeral Sermons, for Marriages, for Burials, for Bread and Wine, for Churching of Women, for Smoke paſſing up the Chimneys; he aſſigned them no ſuch Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but when the Curtain of Apoſtacy had over-ſpread <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the Beaſt that had long plunged in the Sea, was riſen out of the Sea, the Man of Sin got into the Temple, he brought forth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thoſe that preach the Goſpel muſt live of the Goſpel, even ſo hath the Lord ordained; ſo that the Goſpel Miniſtry is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Ordinance for their Maintenance; and this Ordinance is of the Lord, excluding all Ordinances of Apoſtatized men, of Popes and Earthly Powers; on that account, the Goſpel Miniſtry hath an Ordinance for their Maintenance. <hi>Where is it? may ſome ſay.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Chriſt ſending out his Diſciples, taught them to eat and drink ſuch things as their Converts ſet before them, ſaying, <hi>The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his Hire:</hi> Here a Hire was appointed, free and voluntary from ſuch as received them, and here is an Ordinance for it. True it is, thoſe that preach the Goſpel muſt live of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, on that Maintenance which hath Goſpel Allowance; living on the Goſpel is entailed on preaching the Goſpel; no other Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Wiſdom's Children juſtifie, than what Chriſt ordained for his Miniſters; and his Ordinance was to eat and drink, receive Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Converts. But Man-made Miniſters are for living of the Law, and of the Gifts, Grants and Donations of Apoſtatized Powers, and of ſuch as ſuppoſed or ſuppoſe the ſame Due. To what hath been ſpoken, I may add two or three Teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They do live of the Goſpel (ſaith <hi>Proſper</hi>) who will he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators of nothing, who neither have, nor deſire to have any thing, not poſſeſſing their own, but the common Goods.

               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> avouched, that the Lord ordained that they that Preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, he ſeems to have regard unto what the Lord ſaid; The Work-man is worthy of his Meat, <hi>Aug. Marl.</hi>

               <p>Neither Chriſt nor the Apoſtles ever ordained any other Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for Goſpel-Miniſters, then what was Free and Voluntary, and that from ſuch as received them and their Meſſage: Now they who repeal this, and in the room thereof violently intrude the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive exaction of Tythes, and that as well from them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them not, as from thoſe that receive them; ſuch Preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, ſuch <hi>Paul</hi> pronounced Anathema.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtles ſent by Chriſt, a Prieſt forever after the Order of <hi>Melshizedec,</hi> who were to teach all Nations, to obſerve all that he commanded them; Mark, All and every thing, and nothing elſe, according to my reading in Scripture, and ſound Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, never taught any, that the Maintenance of the Goſpel-Miniſtry was to be by way of Tythes; which may ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that that <hi>Levitical</hi> courſe of Maintenance was not in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Ambaſſage and Commiſſion, to be perpetuated in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel dayes.</p>

                  <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was but a Type of the everlaſting Order, ſhadowing out the Eternal high Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus; Chriſt was not the <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec,</hi> but after the Similitude of <hi>Melehizedec;</hi> if after the Similitude, Shadow or Type, then <hi>Melchizedec</hi> could not be the Subſtance, the thing typified: for the thing ſimilating, cannot be the thing ſimilated: So that <hi>Abram</hi> gave Tythe to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> made like unto the Son of God, a Figure, Shadow, Type. Now the Prieſthood of Chriſt muſt needs be the End, Sum, Subſtance of the Shadow; which Subſtance being come, the Shadow with all its appurtenances, whereof <hi>Tythe</hi> was one, muſt vaniſh and be of no longer force: The paying of that which was proper and peculiar to the Similitude or Type, ſhews that the Similitude or Type is ſtill in force: So the Subſtance not come; for while the Shadow is in force, there is no place for the Subſtance; therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of <hi>Tythes</hi> for the Miniſters of the everlaſting high Prieſt, is a denyal of Chriſt come in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Again, all the Tythe of the Land, whether of the Seed of the Land, or of the Fruit of the Tree, it was the Lord's, it was Holy unto the Lord; hereby Prieſt, <hi>Levite</hi> and the Poor were relieved, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. A Type of Chriſt, the Subſtance, who was called the Holy thing, in whom the Obedient are ſanctified, nouriſhed, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of their minds, a living Sacrifice unto God.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Tythe,</hi> or at the leaſt ſome part thereof, was an Heave-Offering, offered unto the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. A Shadow, a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, (ſaith <hi>Wilſon</hi> in his compleat Chriſtiain Dictionary) as other Oblations were. So that the pleading for this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Offering, is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102409:54"/>a denyal of Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh; and you may as well plead for the Meat-Offering, Sin-Offering, Burnt-Offering Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs-Offering, Wave-Offering, as for the Heave-Offering in Goſpel-days.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed my Judgment, that <hi>Tythe</hi> was a legal Type, Figure or Shadow, peculiar unto the Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that it terminated with that Miniſtration; I might add the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many, ſeveral of whom have been eminent in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, who have ſpoken to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>The payment of <hi>Tythes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fulke</hi>) as it was a Ceremonial duty, it is abrogated with other Ceremonies by the Death of Chriſt. On <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4.</p>
                  <p>Further, neither did Chriſt our high Prieſt ever make claim unto <hi>Tythes,</hi> nor his Apoſtles, Miniſter of the Church, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a ſufficient living by the Goſpel, to be allowed of their temporal Goods, to them from whom they had received Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things. <hi>Fulke</hi> on the ſame.</p>

This Precept of the Law</hi> (ſay they) <hi>had an end by Chriſt, as the precept of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Chriſt ſaid, Give Alms of thoſe things that remain; but he ſaid not, Give the Tenth of the Goods which ye poſſeſs.</hi> This is the ſum of their Teſtimony on that account.</p>

                  <hi>Andrew Willet,</hi> a ſtout oppoſer of <hi>Popery,</hi> in the reign of King <hi>James,</hi> called the Law of Tythes <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> acknowledging, <hi>That men are not neceſſarily bound by the Law of God to pay Tythes now.</hi> Further, he ſaith, <hi>That the payment of Tythes was a wiſe and politick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and might conveniently be retained; yet it is not now of neceſſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>as though no other Proviſion for the Church could ſerve but that,</hi> Willets Synopſ.

               <p>Some plead the Decrees, Canons and Conſtitutions of General Councils, Popes, Biſhops, Convocations, ſaying, That <hi>Tythes</hi> are due, <hi>jure Eecleſiaſtico.</hi> Others plead the Gifts of Kings and Princes.

               <p>I Anſwer; Theſe Claims have been perticularly anſwered, and that again and again: So I ſay in the general, How can humane Laws made for the payment of <hi>Tythes,</hi> ſince Chriſt came in the Fleſh, bind the Conſcience of any man? Seeing the end, ſcope, purpoſe, intent and tendency of thoſe Laws are for the eſtabliſhment of that which Chriſt put an End unto, whoſe prerogative it is, to have Rule, Regiment, Government in all, where the Myſtery of Faith is held in a pure Conſcience.</p>

               <p>Again, Chriſt ſending forth his Diſciples, ſaid, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Matth. 28. Conſider this, they were to teach all that Chriſt commanded them, and nothing elſe; not what apoſtatized Powers ſhould command or impoſe: Here the Decrees, Canons, Laws and Conſtitutions of men, ſetting up that which Chriſt put an end unto, and forcing a Maintenance, are excluded.</p>
               <p>Again, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preached, that <hi>Chriſt ſhould have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in all things,</hi> Col. 1.18. If in all things, then in the concern of the Maintenance of the Goſpel Miniſtry. Now ſuch as ſlight the free and voluntary Maintenance of the Goſpel, and plead for Tythes and a compulſary Maintenance, ſuch would have man to have Pre-eminence, ſuch are Miniſters of man. Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, If you were of</hi> Abraham, <hi>you would do the Works of</hi> Abraham. So may I ſay, If you were of Chriſt, you would do the Works of Chriſt, and be content with his allowance: <hi>John</hi> bare record, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> 2 John 9. And ſuch as are without God, they are Hetrodox, Heretical, yea, Atheiſtical; and ſuch as ſtand to man's Maintenance, and not Chriſt's, they are in Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>Did not Chriſt ſay, that all Power in Heaven and in Earth was committed to him? Is not he indued with Soveraign Power? Was not he appointed of the Father to be Law-giver to, of, and in the Church? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> foretell of a departure from the Faith, an Apoſtacy? and that the man of Sin ſhould be revealed, that he ſhould ſit in the Temple of God, in the Church, and ſhew himſelf to be God? This is the great Antichriſt. Now they that deny the Goſpel-Ordinance, which was free and voluntary, and plead for Tythes, and for a compulſary Maintenance introduced by man, ſuch deny Chriſt to be Law-giver to, of, and in the Church: And what is that Spirit that introduces a Maintenance contrary to the Goſpel-Maintenance? Of the man of Sin, of Antichriſt, who is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102409:57"/>againſt Chriſt his Call, Work and Wage, and hath a Call, Work and Wage of his own.</p>
               <p>Do not <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers ſay, That the Beaſt and his ten Horns is the Pope and Popiſh Kings? And by what hath been ſpoken, it may appear how Tythes came into Churches profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and a Compulſary Maintenance. Now is it honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for, or beſſeming ſuch as pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt, to have no Command nor Example from Chriſt for what they act, but from the Beaſt and his Horns, the Pope and his Auxilliaries? Do they not offer great affront to Chriſt, who eſtabliſh that which he diſſanulled? Now if every Ordinance of man, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ever, muſt be ſubmitted to, ſtrange Conſequences might follow; then if one and the ſame Individual Perſon ſhould remove into twenty ſeveral Nations of different Religions, he is bound to hoiſt up his Sails to all theſe Winds, to comply with the Worſhip of every reſpective Nation, if the Supream Authority command it.</p>
               <p>Having touched, that no <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Act, nor the <hi>Levitical,</hi> nor <hi>Evangelical</hi> Diſpenſations, nor Ordinances of man, can aſſure Tythes to Goſpel Miniſters, as truly ſuch, I may ſubjoyn a few Teſtimonies of men eminent in the Church ſince the Apoſtles dayes, who in their Reſpective Ages bare Teſtimony againſt the grand Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Tythes, and other things.</p>

               </p>
               <p>'Twas generally the judgment of the <hi>Wickliffians,</hi> as of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> being all <hi>Protéſtants,</hi>

                  <q>Tythes were and are a free Gift, as among the Chriſtians, and

                  <hi>William Thorp,</hi> Martyr, being complained of by the Popiſh Clergy, was brought to Examination in the year 1407. being accuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> as againſt divers other abuſes crept into the Church, ſo alſo againſt Tythes he gave faithful Teſtimony, ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the New Law, neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ever took Tythe of the People, neither commanded they the People to pay Tythe: And Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached the Word of God to the People, and lived of pure Alms, or free Gifts; and after Chriſt's Aſſention, when the Apoſtles had received the Holy Spirit, they travelled, labouring with their Hands, not to be Chargeable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Further, ſaith he, <q>Tythes were given in the old Law to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and Prieſts, but our Prieſts come not of <hi>Levi, ergo,</hi> by the Law our Prieſts cannot challenge Tythes; for as the Prieſthood is changed, ſo is the Law; but ſince Chriſt, in the time of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and alſo his Apoſtles, lived by pure Alms, or elſe by the Labours of their Hands; for the Servant is not greater than his Lord.</q> At which words, the Biſhop ſaid unto him, <hi>God's Curſe have you, and mine, for thus teaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>William Thorp</hi> ſaid, <q>Thoſe Prieſts that do take Tythes, they deny Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh.</q> Further, bearing Teſtimony againſt the Covetouſneſs and Pride of the Prieſts: The Biſhop anſwered, <hi>By God, I deem him more meek that

                  <hi>William Swinderby</hi> teſtified to this purpoſe, <q>If Pariſhioners pay Tythes to wicked Prieſts or Curats, they are guilty before God of upholding them in their Sins and Evil Deeds. Further, ſaith he, Chriſts Law commands to miniſter freely to the People; the Pope with his Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ells or Money: Chriſts Law teaches his Prieſts to be Poor; the Pope juſtifies and maintains Prieſts to be Lords, <hi>Fox Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walter Brute</hi> teſtified, as appears by the Articles charged againſt him; <q>
                     <hi>1ſt,</hi> That no man is bound to pay Tythes in Goſpel times. <hi>2dly,</hi> If any Prieſt receive any thing by way of Bargain or yearly Stipend, in ſo doing he is a Schiſmatick, and accurſed. <hi>3dly,</hi> That if we be bound to pay Tythes in Goſpel times, then are we Debtors to keep the whole Law; for he that was the End of one part was the end of the whole. <hi>4thly,</hi> Seeing that neither Chriſt, nor any of his Apoſtles commanded to pay Tythes, 'tis manifeſt and plain, that neither by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor by the Law of Chriſt Chriſtians are bound to pay Tythes, but by mans Traditions, <hi>Fox Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi>
                  </q> A Sound Teſtimony and true, but oppoſed by Man made Miniſters.</p>
               <p>About the year 1431. <hi>Lodovicus,</hi> a man much praiſed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaney and Wiſdom, ſaid to the Clergy; <q>If you were true Biſhops and true Paſtors of Souls, you would not doubt to put your Lives in hazard for your Sheep, neither be afraid to ſhed your Blood for the Church in the Cauſe of Chriſt; but at this preſent, ſaith he, 'tis too rare to find a Prelate which doth not prefer his Temporalities before his Spiritualities; with the Love whereof they are ſo withdrawn, that they ſtudy rather to pleaſe Princes than God, &amp;c. <hi>Aen.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> ſpeaking of the drying up the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi> brings in the judgment of his Anonymus, that is, Nameleſs Author, which he approves of, which is:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the preaching of the Goſpel doth &amp; ſhall cauſe men to take away all Temporal Things, that is, Poſſeſſions, and Earthly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from the Clergy, and they ſhall no more be given them.</q> Herein I accord with him, that as far as the Virtue and Power of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102409:59"/>the Goſpel truly renews, transforms and changes men, ſo far 2 Faithfull and Living Teſtimony ſhall be born to the Free and Voluntary Maintenance of the Goſpel, and againſt the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Maintenance by Tythes, and other Groundleſs, Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Co-ercive Maintenance, Truth prevailing, this ſhall be ſcoured away.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is againſt the holy Scripture (ſaith <hi>Wickliff</hi>) for Church-men to have Poſſeſſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerardus Sagarellus,</hi> who lived before <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s time, denyed a divine Right to Tythes in Goſpel days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſmus</hi> boldly affirmed, That the common exacting of Tythes by the Clergy, in his Time, was no better than Tyranny.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time it was no general Law nor Cuſtom in the Church, that Tythes ſhould be paid; <hi>Willet</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis of Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When the Diſciples (ſaith <hi>Walter Brute</hi>) ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, we have left all, and have followed thee; what ſhall we have?</hi> He anſwered not thus, Tythes ſhall be paid you; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he promiſe them a Temporal, but an Everlaſting Reward in Heaven; for Food and Apparel he taught his Diſciples not to be careful: <hi>Paul</hi> right-well remembring his Doctrine, gave <hi>Timothy</hi> this Inſtruction; <hi>Having Food and Rayment, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be content, Fox Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Primitive Non-payment of Tythes (ſaith one) is a pregnant Argument, that they did not underſtand Tythes to be appointed by Chriſt for his Miniſters; <hi>He that knows his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Had it been (ſaith <hi>Selden</hi> of Tythes) the Apoſtles Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or the Uſe of the Church in the Primitive Times, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not have been ſo ſilent in it.</p>
                  <p>Is it likely (ſaith he) that all the old Councils, from thence, till near ſix Hundred Years after Chriſt, which have ſpecial Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons for the Lands and Goods poſſeſt by the Church, &amp;c. could have omitted the Name of Tenths, if either ſuch Uſe, or Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Law had preceeded?</p>
               </q>
               <p>Some of the aforeſaid, for their Teſtimony againſt Tythes, as againſt other Errors, Hereſies, Superſtition and Idolatry of <hi>Italian Babylon,</hi> ſuffered in Flames, as Hiſtories demonſtrate.</p>

               <p>To draw to a Concluſion; By what hath been ſaid, 'tis apparent to all ſeeing Eyes, that according to Chriſt's Doctrine, the Apoſtles were not to receive any thing, but from ſuch as received them, and their Doctrine, from ſuch as reaped their Spiritual Things. But now, all that are found within the Limits, Precincts, Bounds of ſuch or ſuch a Pariſh, firſt ſet up by the Pope and his Emiſſaries, after ratified by Earthly Princes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Believers or Unbelievers, Prophane, Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Excommunicated Perſons; yea, ſuch as they'l Curſe, and give up to Satan, of theſe they'l have Tythes, Eaſter-Reckonings, Midſummer-Dues, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries, Oblations, Smoke-Money, which they claim as Due, being introduced by Apoſtatized men; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Cloak, <hi>He that preaches the Goſpel, muſt live of the Goſpel;</hi> when as the Goſpel warrants no ſuch thing.
